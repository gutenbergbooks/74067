<h2 class="nobreak">FOREWORD</h2>
</div></div>


<p>The use of emergency power in a democracy raises many questions
relative to the constitutional basis for its authorization and the
manner of its exercise. If used too little and too late a democratic
state might be destroyed when the proper use of the emergency power
possibly could have saved it. If used arbitrarily and capriciously,
its use could degenerate into the worst form of dictatorship.</p>

<p>As a boy I was the chauffeur for a country doctor. One day while
driving to see a patient who was gravely ill, the doctor opened his
medicine chest and pointed to a glass vial containing morphine.
“That drug,” he said, “is the most potent medicine in my chest
but requires great skill in prescribing. Used properly it relieves
pain and suffering. Used improperly it makes animals of men.”
Emergency power bears to government the same general relationship
of morphine to man. Used properly in a democratic state it never
supplants the constitution and the statutes but is restorative in
nature. Used improperly it becomes the very essence of tyranny.</p>

<p>By reference to particular statutes and specific instances this
volume affords a graphic picture of the broad extent to which
emergency power has been employed by the United States government
in recent years. Many will view this development with alarm
for the many instances of its use make a lengthy list. Military
emergency today is but one type of national emergency. Catastrophes
and economic emergencies may also require the exercise of
this type of power. Indeed, its use in this day and time has been
so frequent that the very term “emergency” is being “shorn of
meaning.”</p>

<p>In the present volume the authors describe and comment upon
the use of emergency power in the United States since 1933. It
is their contention that the use of emergency power was contemplated
and provided for in the Constitution. The law also provides restraints
upon its use. As Professor McIlwain has concluded, the
proper test of constitutionalism is the existence of adequate processes
for keeping government responsible. It is comforting to know
that these processes exist within our government. The primary
requirement of all Americans, then, is to keep government responsible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
and within these limitations, for only when this is done can
emergency power be justified under the law of the land.</p>

<p>The always present danger is that emergency power may be
used by an officer or an agency of the government in order to have
its own way when constitutional or other legal restrictions might
irritate or interfere. This danger can be lessened by the selection
of good governmental personnel, but removed to a greater degree
by the enforcement of these constitutional and statutory limitations
which are made effective at times by resort to judicial review.</p>

<p>Readers will be indebted to the authors for this first exhaustive
account of the actual use of emergency power by the United States
government since 1933. The restraint on the freedom of the individual,
the regulation of private enterprise, the control of communications
are but some of the topics that receive minute and
careful treatment. Some readers will be concerned with the frequency
of the resort to emergency power and will view with uneasiness,
as does this writer, the possible curtailment of individual
rights. Yet the authors would be the first to agree with the statement
that, “Freedom and civil liberties, far from being incompatible
with security, are vital to our national strength.” Security and
rights are here made interdependent. Others will take satisfaction
in the flexibility of the United States government that can maintain
its democratic character and still have the means of preserving
its existence under the tremendous pressure of a world war and
periods of economic crises. Irrespective of attitude, the present
volume is a telling account of the manner in which the government
of the United States has been made adaptable under the Constitution
to the problems and exigencies of the modern world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>A preface is a kind of last call to dinner, as it were, in which the
authors suggest the purpose of their undertaking, chart the course
they have chosen to pursue, and acknowledge the help they have
received.</p>

<p>This study of the President’s use of emergency powers grew out
of research and discussions in Washington, D. C., and at Harvard,
the University of California, and other institutions. In one sense,
it is a sequel to Dr. Cotter’s study of emergency powers in Great
Britain, prepared under Harvard’s Sheldon Travelling Fellowship
during the academic year 1951-52.</p>

<p>In preparing a political science course at the University of California’s
Riverside campus, one of the most significant gaps in available
sources and treatises about the Presidency concerned the vast
range of power, generally called emergency powers, available to the
Chief Executive should he choose to follow the prescription used
by many predecessors, notably F.D.R.</p>

<p>Both authors have, of course, profited from the monumental work
of Professor Edward S. Corwin, whose classic study, <cite>The President:
Office and Powers</cite> remains the outstanding work in the field. Professor
Robert S. Rankin’s study, <cite>When the Civil Law Fails</cite>, contained
valuable historical data of particular importance. Both authors
have also had the inestimable privilege and opportunity of studying
under Professor Charles Fairman, now at Harvard Law School.
Professor Fairman’s study, <cite>The Law of Martial Rule</cite>, was very helpful
in providing the historical setting for government under military
control. The authors were fortunate in having read Professor Fairman’s
paper delivered at the National War College, “A Post-Atomic
Attack Situation,” wherein it is clearly brought forth that a complete
plan and pattern for dealing with a nuclear attack must be
worked out that does envisage the restoration of civil government
to the nation as quickly as circumstances permit, should the cold
war ever turn into an all-out nuclear holocaust.</p>

<p>While the original work on the manuscript was completed before
either of the authors came to Washington, both have benefitted
from the experience of working in the Pentagon, the Commission on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
Civil Rights, the Republican National Committee and the U. S.
Senate. One is apt to view the executive branch of government
from a slightly different perspective, once having been associated
with “the Hill.” And, while the Congress may feel powerless to
act against a determined Chief Executive, the power of the purse
still provides the most effective of all the “checks and balances” in
our national government, except in time of war.</p>

<p>The Fund for the Republic provided the authors with a grant-in-aid
in 1955 to begin work on the book, although the Fund had
no contact or association with the authors during the preparation of
the manuscript.</p>

<p>Parts of some chapters have previously appeared as article in
the <cite>Western Political Quarterly</cite> and <cite>The Journal of Politics</cite>, and
the authors wish to acknowledge their appreciation at being able
to reproduce all or parts of these articles.</p>

<p>Mr. Warren Campbell served as a helpful research assistant while
a graduate student at Stanford and rendered invaluable aid. Dr.
Norman Small of the American Law Division of the Library of Congress
performed an essential editorial task in reading the entire
manuscript and suggesting very useful changes.</p>

<p>The authors are both grateful to Mrs. Connie Smith, a patient
wife, who spent long, dreary hours typing and re-typing the manuscript.
And, last, but by no means least, the authors reserve a
special vote of the very deepest appreciation to the Executive Director
of Public Affairs Press, Mr. M. B. Schnapper whose patience,
confidence and continued good humor made publication possible.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ABOUT THE AUTHORS</h2>
</div>


<p>J. Malcolm Smith received his education at the U.S. Naval
Academy, the University of Washington, and Stanford University.
After three years as an officer in the Army during World War II,
he received an A.B. degree from the University of Washington in
1946, and an M.A. (1948) and Ph.D. (1951) from Stanford University.
He has combined academic and governmental service
since he began his career as an instructor in political science at
Stanford University in 1947. He has taught at Columbia University
and the University of California. He organized the first
World Affairs Council in Los Angeles, for the Foreign Policy
Association and served as its first Executive Director from 1952-54.</p>

<p>Since coming to Washington, D. C., Mr. Smith served as a
consultant to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (1957-58),
and the President’s Commission on Civil Rights (1958-59) before
joining the staff of Senator Thomas H. Kuchel of California as
Assistant to the Minority Whip of the U.S. Senate.</p>

<p>Cornelius P. Cotter began his academic career at Stanford
University in 1946 following three years as a Navy Seabee in the
Pacific during the Second World War. He received his A.B. in
1949 from Stanford, and an M.P.A. (1951) and Ph.D. in government
(1953) from Harvard University. He was a Sheldon Travelling
Fellow from Harvard University to the University of London
from 1951-52. After serving as Instructor in Government at
Columbia University 1952-53, he returned to his alma mater,
Stanford, in 1953 as an Assistant Professor of Political Science.
He is currently on leave as an Associate Professor from Stanford
University to serve as a special assistant to the Chairman of
the Republican National Committee, Senator Thruston B. Morton.
From December 1958 to December 1959, he served as the Citizenship
Clearinghouse Fellow to the Republican National Committee.</p>

<p>The authors have contributed to the Western Political Quarterly,
Stanford Law Review, the Journal of Politics, and the Midwestern
Political Science Review. Currently they are collaborating
on a textbook in American Government.</p>

<p>This study of presidential emergency powers was initiated by
the authors in 1955 while teaching at Stanford and the University
of California; revision and expansion were undertaken in Washington,
D. C., during 1959 and 1960.</p>

</div>


<p>The general welfare, and military effectiveness of a modern industrial
nation depend upon the harmonious interaction of a complex,
interdependent network of production and transportation facilities.
The interruption of this process at any of a myriad of critical points
can disrupt the supply of essential civilian and military materials,
possibly undermining the economic health or military security of
the nation.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The urban concentration of population and the refinement
of communication devices and techniques for manipulating public
opinion make it increasingly possible to instill in the civilian population
an hysteria and terror which could effectively thwart national
mobilization.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Realization of the magnitude of the problem, and a
pervasive fear of military assault, vitally influence the process of
continuous redefinition of the balance between collective authority
and individual liberty which is the essential task of democratic government
in war as in peace. Emergency government has become the
norm for twentieth century constitutional states.</p>

<p>An assessment of the adequacy with which democratic government
has, in the recurrent economic and military emergencies since
1933, combined mobilization of “the ... power of every individual and
of every material resource at its command”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> toward the objective
of national survival and well-being, with the protection of basic individual
freedoms and the principle of responsible government which
are the heart of democracy, must in substantial part rest upon an
analysis of the contents of the statute books. That is the purpose
of this study. Its classification of legislative delegations of emergency
powers to the executive since 1933 should provide not only indication
of the extent to which coercive powers over persons and property
have been granted the executive in the name of emergency, but also
a framework for the organization of a series of studies into the use
of such powers by the executive branch, and the success of congressional
and other efforts to maintain responsible administration in time
of emergency.</p>

<p>There exists no dearth of recorded efforts to define the ultimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
scope of the constitutional emergency power of the American executive.
Various justices of the Supreme Court have hypothesized, at
one end of a continuum, inflexible constitutional restraints upon
executive response to perceived emergency,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and at the other end
an emergency power which is either unrestrained<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> or unrestrainable.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
In this manner the Supreme Court has sought to resolve the conundrum,
“How can a virtually unlimited emergency power and a systematic
body of constitutional limitations upon government action
logically coexist? How can constitutionalism be ought but an anachronism
in the twentieth century unless constitutional governments
are equipped with adequate legal authority to carry the body politic
through economic and military emergencies of staggering dimensions?”</p>

<p>The considerable body of scholarly literature in this field is principally
devoted to speculation on the breadth of the “inherent,”
“residual,” “executive,” or “war” power of the President, and description
of occasions on which the nation’s chief executives have
considered it necessary to exercise a prerogative “power to act according
to discretion for the public good, without the prescription of
the law and sometimes even against it.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But despite such incidents
as President Roosevelt’s 1942 Labor Day speech admonishing the
Congress that unless it repealed certain provisions of the Emergency
Price Control Act by October 1st, he would consider them repealed,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
emergency administration is overwhelmingly characterized by joint
participation and cooperation of the varying branches of the federal
government. American government in time of war does not degenerate
to anything resembling dictatorship, and to focus attention upon
the exceptions to executive-legislative cooperation in war administration
is to study the pathology of emergency administration.</p>

<p>The statute books provide at any given time a more accurate indication
of the breadth and limits of executive emergency power
than do exegeses on the Constitution, or histories emphasizing executive
action unsupported by Congress. For in theory<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and in practice
the President will resort to an “inherent” emergency power only to
the extent to which Congress has failed to anticipate and prescribe
remedial action for such an emergency. On the assumption that a
detailed study of the emergency powers which have been delegated
to the executive by Congress in the immediate past provides insight
into the probable range of such powers which will be exercised by
government in the future, the authors have undertaken to survey
and classify such delegations in the period 1933 to 1955.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span></p>

<p>It is believed that the accumulation in selected contexts of the
instances of legislative delegation of emergency power will provide
striking revelation of the scope and detail of control over individuals
and groups which is practiced by constitutional governments in time
of emergency. To this we now turn.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter II</span>
<br><span class="cheaderfont">THE CONCEPT OF EMERGENCY IN DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL THOUGHT</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When President Eisenhower on June 16, 1955 suspended the privilege
of the writ of <i lang="la">habeas corpus</i> and declared a nationwide state of
mock martial law, in response to simulated A-bomb and H-bomb attacks
taking a toll of some 14 million civilian casualties, he acted on
the premise that the ordinary processes of democratic and constitutional
government do not suffice to protect the state in time of emergency
and must surrender to a modified authoritarian regime.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> This
premise is deeply embedded in the teachings of democratic political
theory, which in its traditional and contemporary expression have
counseled the need to abandon the processes of democratic government
as the first essential response to emergency conditions.</p>

<p>Thus, ironically, the Western democracies which today approach
the close of three decades of economic and military emergency, and
turn their faces to additional decades in the shadow-land between
peace and war, are offered a guiding theory which regards emergency
governance as an aberration, supplanting the relationships between
the various branches of government, and between rulers and ruled
which prevail in “normal” times. In theory the struggle to preserve
limited and popularly responsible government has already been lost,
for this is a luxury we are told we cannot afford.</p>

<p>In the United States we have been especially prone to accept the
alleged need for transition from responsible to authoritarian government
in time of emergency, for we have on the one hand accepted
an interpretation of the Constitution whereunder the rigid restraints
imposed thereby on governmental power are susceptible of contradiction
in time of emergency, and on the other hand we have with considerable
complacence assigned to the Supreme Court the function
of protecting the essentials of constitutionalism and democracy
through periods of emergency. These two attitudes combine to enhance
the sense of need and lull the fear of supposedly temporary
reversions to authoritarian government.</p>

<p>In the belief that it is increasingly essential that emergency action<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
be sustained by a workable and empirically-based theory of democratic
emergency governance, the authors have undertaken, in the
present study, to survey the treatment of emergency by democratic
political theorists; to review the work of the Supreme Court
in assessing the validity of governmental exercises of emergency
powers (placing special emphasis upon the implications of the 1952
“Steel Seizure” cases); and, in conclusion, to submit tentatively an
approach to emergency which they consider related to the needs of
today and the realities of recent experience.</p>

<p>Democratic political theorists traditionally have assumed the need
in time of emergency to subvert the governmental processes prescribed
for peacetime and to rely upon a generically different method
of government, frequently designated “constitutional dictatorship.”
Many factors contribute to this tendency.</p>

<p>First, it must be recognized that a theory of democratic government
so comprehensive as to traverse every vicissitude which might
confront it cannot reasonably be demanded of political philosophers.</p>

<p>Second, a certain amount of inertia is inevitable in any phase of
man’s endeavors. Thus it is not surprising that political theorists to
date have picked up the traditional interpretation of emergency in
terms of the Roman dictatorship and fitted it to their schemes of constitutional
government. It is a safely ambiguous doctrine with the
respectability of age. It invests an aspect of the experience of constitutional
democracies, about which very little in the way of cumulative
knowledge has been attained, with an aura of reassuring and doctrinaire
certainty.</p>

<p>A third factor influencing the casual reliance of democratic theorists
on emergency dictatorship is the tendency to polarize the concept
of “limited” government and the supposed need for “unlimited”
emergency action. This is related to the tendency to exaggerate substantively
limited (enumerated) powers, and compartmentalized powers
as integral elements in the concept of constitutionalism.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> In positing
rigidly circumscribed and divided governmental powers, one
posits a need contingent upon emergency to transcend such limitations.
The doctrine of constitutional dictatorship fulfills this need.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Democratic Political Theorists</span></h3>

<p>John Locke, describing the architecture of civil government, called
upon the English doctrine of prerogative to cope with the problem
of emergency. In times of danger to the nation, positive law set down
by the legislature might be inadequate or even a fatal obstacle to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
promptness of action necessary to avert catastrophe. In these situations
the Crown retained a prerogative “power to act according to
discretion for the public good, without the prescription of the law
and sometimes even against it.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The prerogative “can be nothing
but the people’s permitting their rulers to do several things of their
own free choice where the law is silent, and sometimes too against the
direct letter of the law, for the public good and their acquiescing in
it when so done.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Properly the prerogative was exercisable only for the public good.
But Locke recognized that this moral restraint might not suffice to
avoid abuse of prerogative powers. When one government has utilized
prerogative powers for the public good, a successor may retain
the habit or resort to such powers, utilizing them for a less worthy
purpose.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Who shall judge the need for resorting to the prerogative,
and how may its abuse be avoided? Here Locke, too, readily admits
defeat, suggesting that “the people have no other remedy in this,
as in all other cases where they have no judge on earth, but to appeal
to Heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Rousseau also assumed the need for temporary suspension of democratic
processes of government in time of emergency:</p>

<p>“The inflexibility of the laws, which prevents them from adapting
themselves to circumstances, may, in certain cases, render them disastrous,
and make them bring about, at a time of crisis, the ruin of
the State....</p>

<p>“It is wrong therefore to wish to make political institutions so
strong as to render it impossible to suspend their operation. Even
Sparta allowed its laws to lapse.</p>

<p>“... If ... the peril is of such a kind that the paraphernalia of
the laws are an obstacle to their preservation, the method is to nominate
a supreme ruler, who shall silence all the laws and suspend
for a moment the sovereign authority. In such a case, there is no
doubt about the general will, and it is clear that the people’s first
intention is that the State shall not perish. Thus the suspension of
the legislative authority is in no sense its abolition; the magistrate
who silences it cannot make it speak; he dominates it, but cannot
represent it. He can do anything, except make laws.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Rousseau did not fear the abuse of the emergency dictatorship or
“supreme magistracy” as he termed it. It would more likely be
cheapened by “indiscreet use.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>He would rely upon a tenure of office of prescribed duration to avoid
perpetuation of the dictatorship:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span></p>

<p>“However this important trust be conferred, it is important that its
duration should be fixed at a very brief period, incapable of being
ever prolonged. In the crises which lead to its adoption, the State
is either soon lost, or soon saved; and, the present need passed, the
dictatorship becomes either tyrannical or idle. At Rome, where dictators
held office for six months only, most of them abdicated before
their time was up. If their term had been longer, they might well
have tried to prolong it still further, as the decemvirs did when chosen
for a year. The dictator had only time to provide against the need
that had caused him to be chosen; he had none to think of further
projects.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Rousseau was unwilling to rely upon an “appeal to Heaven.”</p>

<p>John Stuart Mill concluded his ardent defense of representative
government with a shattering aside: “I am far from condemning,
in cases of extreme necessity, the assumption of absolute power in
the form of a temporary dictatorship.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This is not a loose usage
of the term “dictatorship,” but a forthright support of a grant of
“absolute power” to the dictator.</p>

<p>Just as in political theory the nineteenth century liberals neglected
adequately to provide for the problems which war creates, so also
in their economic theory they ignored the dislocations of a war period.
In his study of war in the nineteenth century,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Edmund Silberner
has shown how the liberals’ repugnance to the destructiveness of
war, their conviction of its immorality and stupidity, coupled with
their faith that the economic and cultural bonds which would be
created among nations by extensive free trade would prevent future
wars, caused them to neglect adequate theoretical treatment of the
problem of war in their economic thought. Silberner points out, for
example, that in his chief work, <cite>Elements of Political Economy</cite>
(1821), James Mill virtually does not deal at all with war.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> And
Mill’s distinguished son is brief on the subject of war. John Stuart
Mill, according to Silberner’s interpretation, seemed to admit that
virtually everything that can be said on this theme had already been
expressed before him.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Thus do democratic political theorists tacitly admit the existence
of a fatal defect in any system of constitutional democracy: Its processes
are inadequate to confront and overcome emergency.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Machiavelli</span></h3>

<p>Machiavelli’s view of emergency powers as one element in the
whole scheme of limited government furnishes an ironic contrast to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
the Lockean theory of prerogative. He recognized and attempted
to bridge this chasm in democratic political theory:</p>

<p>“Now in a well-ordered republic it should never be necessary to
resort to extra-constitutional measures; for although they may for
the time be beneficial, yet the precedent is pernicious, for if the
practice is once established of disregarding the laws for good objects,
they will in a little while be disregarded under that pretext for evil
purposes. Thus no republic will ever be perfect if she has not by law
provided for everything, having a remedy for every emergency, and
fixed rules for applying it.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Machiavelli attempted, perhaps without complete success, but
with greater caution than the later theorists, to design a system of
constitutionalized emergency powers.</p>

<p>The incumbent executive authority, on finding that an emergency
existed, could appoint a temporary “dictator”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> on the Roman model.
The constitution was not suspended, and the emergency executive
did not enjoy absolute power. His narrow function was to cope with
the emergency.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> He operated under the surveillance of the regularly
constituted legislators and government officials. A key element
of Machiavelli’s scheme was a short term of office—“and I
call a year or more <a id="Ref_8" href="#BRef_8">a long time.”</a><a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Thus Machiavelli—in contrast to Locke, Rousseau and Mill—sought
to incorporate into the constitution a regularized system of
standby emergency powers to be invoked with suitable checks and
controls in time of national danger. He attempted forthrightly to
meet the problem of combining a capacious reserve of power and
speed and vigor in its application in time of emergency, with effective
constitutional restraints.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Contemporary Theorists</span></h3>

<p>Contemporary political theorists, addressing themselves to the
problem of response to emergency by constitutional democracies,
have employed the doctrine of constitutional dictatorship. Criticism
of their schemes for emergency governance is made difficult
by the ambiguities latent in the terminology they adopt. An effort
is made below to distinguish between those who mean dictatorship
when they say dictatorship, and those who say dictatorship when
they mean to refer to any effort by constitutional government to
respond adequately to emergency conditions. However idiosyncratic
the individual definitions of dictatorship, the theories of constitutional
dictatorship explicitly or implicitly posit a transition in time of emergency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
from the processes of constitutionalism to those of an outright
or slightly modified authoritarian system.</p>

<p>Frederick M. Watkins, who is responsible for the classic study of
the Weimar experience with emergency powers,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> appears to have
based his general discussion of emergency powers upon <i lang="la">a priori</i> reasoning
rather than upon empirical research.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Provided it “serves to
protect established institutions from the danger of permanent injury
in a period of temporary emergency, and is followed by a prompt
return to the previous forms of political life,” Watkins can see “no
reason why absolutism should not be used as a means for the defense
of liberal institutions.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> He recognized the two key elements of the
problem of emergency governance, as well as all constitutional governance:
increasing administrative powers of the executive while at
the same time “imposing limitations upon that power.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> He rejects
legislative checks upon the exercise of executive emergency powers
as an effective method of imposing such limitations, for “it is clearly
unrealistic to rely on a government-controlled majority in the legislature
to exercise effective supervision over that same government in
its use of emergency powers.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> On the other hand, judicial review of
executive emergency action on its merits is regarded with admiration
tempered only by regret at the delay inherent in judicial proceedings.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>Watkins places his real faith in a scheme of “constitutional dictatorship.”
These are the conditions of success of such a dictatorship:
“The period of dictatorship must be relatively short.... Dictatorship
should always be strictly legitimate in character.... Final authority
to determine the need for dictatorship in any given case must never
rest with the dictator himself....”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The objective of such an emergency
dictatorship should be “strict political conservatism.”</p>

<p>“Radical social and economic measures may, of course, be necessary
as a means of preventing political change.... Boldly inventive as it
may be in other directions, however, a truly constitutional dictatorship
must always aim at the maintenance of an existing <i lang="la">status quo</i>
in the field of constitutional law. Deviations from the established
norms of political action may be necessary for the time being. The
function of a truly constitutional dictatorship is to provide such deviations
and at the same time to make sure that they do not go any
further than is actually necessary under the circumstances.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Carl J. Friedrich casts his analysis in terms similar to those of Watkins.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
It is a problem of concentrating power—in a government
where power has consciously been divided—“to cope with ... situations
of unprecedented magnitude and gravity.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> There must be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
broad grant of powers, subject to equally strong limitations as to who
shall exercise such powers, when, for how long, and to what end.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
Professor Friedrich, too, offers criteria for judging the adequacy of
any scheme of emergency powers. The emergency executive (“dictator”)
must be appointed by constitutional means—<i lang="la">i.e.</i>, he must
be legitimate; he should not himself enjoy power to determine the
existence of an emergency (and here, strangely enough, he finds the
United States and Great Britain conforming to the criterion); emergency
powers should be exercised under a strict time limitation; and
last, the objective of emergency action must be the defense of the
constitutional order.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Recognizing that “there are no ultimate institutional safeguards
available for insuring that emergency powers be used for the purpose
of preserving the constitution” excepting “the people’s own determination
to see them so used,” Friedrich nonetheless sees some indefinite
but influential role which the courts, even though “helpless
in the face of a real emergency,” may play to restrict the use
of emergency powers to legitimate goals. They may “act as a sort
of keeper of the President’s and the people’s conscience.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Clinton L. Rossiter, after surveying the recent history of the employment
of emergency powers in Great Britain, France, Weimar
Germany, and the United States, reverts to a description of a scheme
of “constitutional dictatorship” as solution to the vexing problems
presented by emergency.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Like Watkins and Friedrich, he is concerned
to state, <i lang="la">a priori</i>, the conditions of success of the “constitutional
dictatorship.”</p>

<p>“1. No general regime or particular institution of constitutional
dictatorship should be initiated unless it is necessary or even indispensable
to the preservation of the state and its constitutional
order....</p>

<p>“2. ... the decision to institute a constitutional dictatorship should
never be in the hands of the man or men who will constitute the
dictator....”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>“3. No government should initiate a constitutional dictatorship
without making specific provision for its termination....</p>

<p>“4. ... all uses of emergency powers and all readjustments in the
organization of the government should be effected in pursuit of constitutional
or legal requirements....</p>

<p>“5. ... no dictatorial institution should be adopted, no right invaded,
no regular procedure altered any more than is absolutely
necessary for the conquest of the particular crisis....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<p>“6. The measures adopted in the prosecution of a constitutional
dictatorship should never be permanent in character or effect....</p>

<p>“7. The dictatorship should be carried on by persons representative
of every part of the citizenry interested in the defense of the
existing constitutional order....</p>

<p>“8. Ultimate responsibility should be maintained for every action
taken under a constitutional dictatorship....</p>

<p>“9. The decision to terminate a constitutional dictatorship, like
the decision to institute one, should never be in the hands of the man
or men who constitute the dictator....</p>

<p>“10. No constitutional dictatorship should extend beyond the termination
of the crisis for which it was instituted....</p>

<p>“11. ... the termination of the crisis must be followed by as complete
a return as possible to the political and governmental conditions
existing prior to the initiation of the constitutional dictatorship....”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Rossiter accords to the legislature (in the case of the United States,
at any rate) a far greater role in the oversight of executive exercise
of emergency powers than does Watkins. He would secure to Congress
final responsibility for declaring the existence or termination
of an emergency,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and he places great faith in the effectiveness of
congressional investigating committees.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> In this work he offers no
clear statement of the proposed relationship of the judiciary to his
scheme of “constitutional dictatorship.” In a subsequent study, he
concluded on the basis of a critical review of the Supreme Court that
it was impotent “as overseer and interpreter of the war powers.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Contemporary Theories in the Light of Recent Experience.</span></h3>

<p>The suggestion that democracies surrender the control of government
to an authoritarian ruler in time of grave danger to the nation
is not based upon sound constitutional theory, or the experience of
Great Britain or the United States in this century.</p>

<p>To appraise emergency powers—in spite of all experience to the contrary—in
terms of the Procrustean mold of constitutional dictatorship
serves merely to distort the problem and hinder realistic analysis.
It matters not whether the term “dictator” is used in its normal sense
(as applied to recent authoritarian rulers) or is employed as Friedrich
makes explicit<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and Rossiter implies, to embrace all chief executives
administering emergency powers. However used, “constitutional
dictatorship” cannot be divorced from the implication of suspension
of the processes of constitutionalism. Suspension is required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
because constitutionalism is viewed as a system imposing and providing
inflexible safeguards against evasion of these limitations.</p>

<p>A concept of constitutionalism which is less misleading in the
analysis of problems of emergency powers, and which is consistent
with the findings of this study, is that formulated by Charles H.
McIlwain.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> While it does not by any means necessarily exclude some
indeterminate limitation upon the substantive powers of government,
full emphasis is placed upon procedural limitations, and political
responsibility. McIlwain clearly recognized the need to repose
adequate power in government. And in discussing the meaning
of constitutionalism he insisted that the historical and proper test
of constitutionalism was the existence of adequate processes for
keeping government responsible. He refused to equate constitutionalism
with the enfeebling of government by an exaggerated emphasis
upon separation of powers and substantive limitations on governmental
power. He found that “the really effective checks on despotism
have consisted not in the weakening of government, but
rather in the limiting of it; between which there is a great and very
significant difference.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> In associating constitutionalism with “limited”
as distinguished from “weak” government, McIlwain meant
government limited to the orderly procedure of law as opposed to the
processes of force.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> “The two fundamental correlative elements of
constitutionalism for which all lovers of liberty must yet fight are
the legal limits to arbitrary power and a complete political responsibility
of government to the governed.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>If such is the basic nature of constitutionalism, it does not wrap
government in the steel bonds of a series of substantive limitations,
or compartmentalize power in discrete units.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The true nature of
the issue which emergency presents for constitutional governments
may then be recognized: It is the two-pronged problem of determining
the extent to which the objectives of human action shall be socially
defined and achieved or self-determined by the individual or
group;<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and, correlatively, that of balancing, through adequate legislative,
administrative and judicial checks, the increased discretionary
powers of the executive which accompany expanded governmental
functions. It is a matter of historical fact that modern constitutional
democracies have not, upon the rise of emergency conditions,
found it necessary to suspend constitutional processes, or to resort
to the schemes for organization of power hypothesized by those who
hitherto have written on the subject.</p>

<p>What the British, particularly, have come to recognize in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
course of the last five decades is that emergency governance is one
form of an acute and continuing problem in modern constitutional
democracies: that of allotting increasing areas of discretionary powers
to the executive, while insuring that such powers will be exercised
with a sense of political responsibility and under effective limitations
and checks.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> In time of emergency, governmental action
may vary in breadth and intensity from more normal times, yet it
need not be less constitutional. In time of war as in peace government
according to the orderly procedure of the law, and government
responsible to the governed, has proven its ability to meet the needs
imposed by the accelerated tempo and the growing complexity of the
twentieth century.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter III</span>
<br><span class="cheaderfont">THE CONCEPT OF EMERGENCY IN AMERICAN LEGISLATION</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Emergency, as a generic term applicable to individual and group
situations as well as to the state, connotes the existence of conditions
suddenly intensifying the degree of existing danger to life or well-being
beyond that which is accepted as normal. (A standard dictionary
definition mentions the element of surprise, which may be
present but is by no means necessarily integral to the existence of
an emergency. An intense threat to life or well-being is not necessarily
lessened by anticipation.) An emergency requires extraordinary
and prompt corrective action. A typical British recital of the
proper objectives of emergency action inferrentially includes “...
securing the public safety, the defense of the realm, the maintenance
of public order and the efficient prosecution of any war in which
His Majesty may be engaged, and ... maintaining supplies and
services essential to the life of the community.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Public disorder,
war and threat of invasion, interruption of the production or flow
of essential supplies and services—any of these may intensify danger
to life or well-being beyond acceptable limits. A similarly broad
definition is contained in the American Labor-Management Relations
Act of 1947, the national emergency section of which permits the
President to curb strike action which “if permitted to occur or to
continue, [would] imperil the national health or safety.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Implicit in these definitions are the elements of intensity, variety,
and perception. Presumably when the point of normal tolerance of
danger has been passed, it remains possible to measure the intensity
of the danger according to some scale. Obviously there are
varieties of emergency. A war emergency differs in some respects
from an emergency caused by natural catastrophe or industrial unrest.
Emergencies vary in their source or cause, and in their impact.
Finally, before corrective action can be taken, someone in a position
of authority must perceive the existence of the emergency.</p>

<p>It would be idle to conduct an analysis of the problem of emergency
in the constitutional state without first determining the range
of situations which have been recognized by democratic legislatures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
and executives to constitute emergencies—<i lang="la">i.e.</i>, to warrant exceptionally
quick, vigorous, and possibly novel action. When the legislature
enacts a standby statute, instead of itself proclaiming an
emergency, to whom does it entrust the power to determine the
existence of an emergency, and within what limits? What are the
powers which democratic legislatures grant the executive branch,
enabling it to so order individual and group behavior as, in the
first instance, to avoid intensification of the threat to the life or well-being
of community and state, and ultimately restore conditions to
normal? Finally, what if any measures are prescribed for insuring
responsible administration of such powers?</p>

<p>This chapter is addressed to the basic questions going to the nature
of emergency—intensity, variety, perception. The remaining parts
of this study respond to the other questions posed above.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Emergencies Vary in Intensity</span></h3>

<p>The executive and the legislature certainly appear to think in terms
of a scale of intensity when they declare emergencies. We might,
perhaps, project our listing from the shadow land verging upon or
falling just short of emergency. A Presidential Proclamation of 1934
speaks of regulations justified by the existence of “exceptional and
exigent circumstances.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> The Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949
uses the terms extraordinary and emergency interchangeably, speaking
of expenditure of unaudited funds “for objects of a confidential,
extraordinary, or emergency nature.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The simple declaration “that
a national emergency exists,”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> contained in the President’s September
8, 1939 Proclamation of a neutrality emergency, will serve as well as
any other enactment as a characteristic example of the scale of intensity
necessary to declare a national emergency.</p>

<p>Beyond this intensity of emergency, Congress has addressed itself
to “distressed” emergencies,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> “serious” emergencies,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> “intensified”
emergencies,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> “unprecedented” emergencies,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
    “acute” emergencies,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
and at the outer extreme, “unlimited” emergencies.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Varieties of Emergency</span></h3>

<p>Emergencies, as perceived by legislature or executive in the United
States since 1933, have been occasioned by a wide range of situations,
classifiable under three principal heads: a. economic, b. natural
disaster, and c. national security.</p>


<h4>ECONOMIC EMERGENCIES</h4>

<p><em>Depression</em>: President Roosevelt in declaring a bank holiday a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
days after taking office in 1933 proclaimed that “heavy and unwarranted
withdrawals of gold and currency from ... banking institutions
for the purpose of hoarding; and ... continuous and increasingly
extensive speculative activity abroad in foreign exchange” resulting
in “severe drains on the Nation’s stocks of gold ... have created a
national emergency,” requiring his action.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The Bank Conservation
Act, passed a few days later gave the President plenary power in time
of war or during any other period of “national emergency” to control
transactions in foreign exchange, transfers of payment, and prevention
of hoarding. It also declared “that a serious emergency exists
and that it is imperatively necessary speedily to put into effect
remedies of uniform national application.”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Later in March, in permitting
Federal Reserve Bank loans to state banks and trust
companies, Congress made specific reference to the existing emergency
in banking.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>The Federal Emergency Relief Act of 1933 opened with a declaration
that the economic depression created a serious emergency, due
to wide-spread unemployment and the inadequacy of State and local
relief funds, resulting in the existing or threatened deprivation of a
considerable number of families and individuals of the necessities of
life, and making it imperative that the Federal Government cooperate
more effectively with the several States and Territories and the
District of Columbia in furnishing relief to their needy and distressed
people.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Here then was an emergency created by the inadequacy
of previous effort to cope with abnormal threats to the well-being
of the population. The Municipal Bankruptcy Act of May 24, 1934
also described the emergency in terms which related it to the inability
of local government units to function properly. Congress declared
a national emergency existed, caused by the increasing financial
difficulties of many local governmental units, which rendered imperative
“the further exercise of the bankruptcy powers of the
Congress.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>On the same day that he signed the Emergency Relief Act, the
President also signed an Act describing another facet of the emergency.
The latter Act stated “the present acute economic emergency”
was in part the result of very low prices for farm products. The effect
of declining income for the American farmer had virtually destroyed
his purchasing power, thus undermining the agricultural assets
supporting the national credit structure.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The causal phenomena
for declarations of emergency were, according to the statutes, heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
and unwarranted withdrawals of gold, severe drains on the Nation’s
stocks of gold, widespread unemployment, and a severe and increasing
disparity between the prices of agricultural and other commodities.
Efforts to meet the emergency situation were directed immediately
to ameliorate the existing emergency conditions and ultimately so
alter the causal phenomena as to eliminate the causes of the existing
threat to national well-being. The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 made
passing reference to “the existing emergency.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> The President in
January 1936 proclaimed that this emergency had not been terminated
but, on the contrary, had been intensified in different ways by unsettled
conditions in international commerce and finance and in foreign
exchange.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> As late as 1941 Congress continued certain of the powers
delegated in the Gold Reserve Act until June 1943 “unless the
President shall sooner declare the existing emergency ended.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>In 1953 Congress authorized the President to declare the existence
of economic disaster in any area. Thereafter the Secretary of Agriculture,
on finding that an economic disaster had created a need for
agricultural credit that could not be met for a temporary period from
commercial banks or other responsible sources, might authorize
emergency loans to farmers.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Some statutes, on the other hand, identify emergency with the
causal phenomena instead of their product. The National Industrial
Recovery Act, for example, simply declared that a national emergency
existed. This emergency, according to the statute was
productive of widespread unemployment and disorganization of
industry, which burdened interstate and foreign commerce, affected
the public welfare, and undermined the standards of living of the
American people.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 found that national emergencies,
which produced widespread unemployment and the dislocation
of trade, transportation, and industry, burdened interstate
commerce and adversely affected the general welfare, were “precipitated,
intensified, and prolonged by manipulation and sudden and
unreasonable fluctuations of security prices and by excessive speculation
on such exchanges and markets.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> In these two statutes the
term emergency is first used in a context associating it with causal
agency, and secondly as something intermediate between the causal
agents and the disagreeable ultimate effects.</p>

<p>While calling attention to the occasionally variable usage of the
term emergency, we by no means intend to develop a metaphysics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
of emergency in order to settle the question whether it is rightfully
applied to cause, effect, or something intermediate. We are satisfied
to accept the overwhelming legislative tendency to apply the term
to the undesired effects of events, attributing variant usages to
imprecise draftmanship.</p>

<p>At this point it is appropriate to indicate that many statutes
(some of which are described here; some of which, for sake of brevity
or avoiding the redundant, are not) either declare the existence of,
or describe action to be taken in the event of the occurrence of, a
situation which by other statutes has been termed an emergency.
Statutes in this category, describing the situation but refraining from
applying the term emergency to them, are illustrated by the following:
A Tariff Act amendment of June 1934 gives the President the power
to curtail imports if he finds that existing duties or other import
restrictions of the United States or any foreign country burden
and restrict the foreign trade of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The Securities
Exchange Act associates emergency, among other things, with the
burdening of interstate and foreign commerce.</p>

<p>Did Congress intend the Tariff Act Amendment as an emergency
statute? At that particular time, probably not. But later amendments
to the Tariff Act specifically refer to emergency conditions
affecting the American fisheries industry. We do not believe it is
necessary to ferret out the precise Congressional intent in Acts which
do not explicitly use the term emergency or describe the object of
correcting legislation in terms which clearly reflect Congress’ finding
that an emergency exists.</p>

<p><em>Inflation</em>: We have included in the economic section some of the
statutes designed to prevent or alleviate wartime inflation. Enacted
within months after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, the Emergency
Price Control Act of 1942 was designed to prevent economic dislocations
from endangering the national defense and security and
the effective prosecution of the war.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The factors contributing to
the national emergency included “speculative, unwarranted, and
abnormal increases in prices and rents; ... profiteering, hoarding,
manipulation, speculation, and other disruptive practices.” The war
effort would be aided through insuring that defense appropriations
were not dissipated by excessive prices; by protecting persons with
relatively fixed and limited incomes, consumers, wage earners, investors,
and persons dependent on life insurance, annuities, and pensions,
from undue impairment of their standard of living through skyrocketing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
prices. Colleges, local government units, and other
institutions with relatively fixed incomes were also to be protected
against the inflationary spiral. The emergency price control measure
was formulated in anticipation of a possible post emergency collapse
of values and was aimed at the avoidance thereof.</p>

<p>The Proclamation of May 27, 1941, in which President Roosevelt
declared the existence of an unlimited emergency caused by the
supposed expanded war aims of the Axis powers, carefully translated
the emergency into economic terms. The President advised businessmen
that in maximizing war production they would be protecting
a world in which free enterprise could exist; and workingmen, in so
doing, would protect a society in which labor and management could
bargain on free and equal terms. Benefits were also forecast for
privately endowed institutions and local governmental units.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The
extension of price controls in 1946 was attributed to the continued
existence “of abnormally excessive spending power in relation to the
presently available supply of commodities.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> And the Renegotiation
Act was addressed to meeting the emergency within an emergency
created by the wartime disruption of competitive conditions in regard
to the placing of defense contracts.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p><em>Strikes</em>: The Emergency Railroad Transportation Act of 1933 was
designed to relieve obstructions and burdens on interstate commerce
resulting from “the present acute economic emergency.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>The Railway Labor Act of 1934 thereupon sought, by imposing
collective bargaining upon the railroads and through a National
Mediation Board and <i lang="la">ad hoc</i> emergency boards appointed by the
President (nothing new, of course, in railroad regulation), to avoid
exacerbation of the emergency through rail strikes.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> The War Labor
Disputes Act permitted drastic presidential and War Labor Board
regulation of labor-management relations to avoid impeding or delaying
the war effort in consequence of strikes.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The Labor Management
Relations Act, better known as the Taft-Hartley Act, created
special procedures for delaying strikes whenever in the opinion of
the President a threatened strike or lock-out affecting an entire
industry or substantial part thereof would imperil the national health
or safety if the strike occurred or were allowed to continue. This Act
of course, grants the determining power to the President only where
interstate commerce, in all its varieties, is involved.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p><em>Housing</em>: The Veterans’ Emergency Housing Act of 1946 declared
that the long-term housing shortage and the war combined to create<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
an unprecedented emergency shortage of housing, particularly for
veterans of World War II and their families.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> President Truman
promptly cited the building program provided for in the Act and the
unprecedented emergency shortage of housing in exercising his
authority under the Tariff Acts to remove the duty from articles
certified by the Housing Expediter as timber, lumber, or lumber
products suitable for the construction or completion of housing accommodations.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
The Housing and Rent Act of 1949 also was directed
at this emergency.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p><em>Agricultural Commodities</em>: Congress occasionally has recognized
the existence of an emergency with regard to a particular agricultural
or other commodity. Without using the term emergency, Congress
plainly was taking emergency action when it adopted a concurrent
resolution in June 1934 directing the Federal Trade Commission to
investigate conditions with respect to the sale and distribution of
milk and other dairy products.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Decline in the price of milk to the
farmer had produced severe hardships and suffering to milk producers
throughout the United States and strikes and violence in many rural
and metropolitan centers. The Resolution went on to say that the
continuation of the practices then engaged in by milk distributors
and certain leaders of milk cooperatives, seriously endangered the
efforts of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration and of the
several States to alleviate and remedy the distress so widespread
among dairy farmers in the United States at the time. If this distress
were permitted to continue the result would be the destruction of
the already sorely pressed agricultural industry. Congress clearly
noted the inability of the states to cope with an emergency situation
and proceeded to initiate its own action.</p>

<p>In like manner the Tobacco Control Act of 1934 was aimed at
improving conditions in the tobacco-growing industry by placing
it on a sound financial and economic basis and by eliminating unfair
competition and practices in the production and marketing of tobacco
entering into the channels of interstate and foreign commerce. Moreover
the Act was in general designed to “relieve the present emergency
with respect to tobacco.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> The Sugar Act of 1937 permitted the
President to suspend certain of its provisions upon a finding that a
national economic or other emergency exists with respect to sugar
or liquid sugar.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The President found conditions sufficiently severe
in the sugar industry to declare a sugar emergency in 1939, 1942, and
1947.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>A 1942 Presidential Proclamation noted that codfish constituted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
one of the basic staples in the diet of the low-income groups in Puerto
Rico. Unfortunately, the war imposed severe limitations on this import
from Canada, Newfoundland and Labrador, thereby vitally affecting
Puerto Ricans dependent on this basic food in their diet.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The
President sought a quick remedy by invoking the emergency provisions
of the Tariff Act of 1930<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> to authorize the duty-free importation
of “jerked beef ... a satisfactory substitute for codfish,” at least
according to the proclamation. Invoking the same statute, the
President, again in April 1942, authorized the duty-free importation
of food, clothes, and medical, surgical, and other supplies by or directly
for the account of The American National Red Cross for use by that
agency in emergency relief work in connection with the “war
emergency.”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>


<h4>EMERGENCIES OCCASIONED BY NATURAL CATASTROPHES</h4>

<p><em>Drought</em>: Two statutes and one Presidential Proclamation in this
category attribute emergency conditions to drought. In February
1934 Congress authorized the Farm Credit Administration to make
loans for feed for livestock in drought- and storm-stricken areas.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
The Emergency Appropriation Act for fiscal 1935 appropriated funds
to meet the emergency and necessity for relief in stricken agricultural
areas and in another section referred to “the present drought emergency.”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
The Presidential Proclamation noting that an unusual
lack of rain in several western and mid-western states had caused an
acute shortage of feed for livestock,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> declared an emergency under the
suitable provision of the 1930 Tariff Act and authorized suspension
of duties on livestock feeds. Only livestock owners in the affected
area were eligible to benefit from duty free livestock feeds.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>The Communications Act of 1934<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and its 1951 amendment<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> grant
the President certain powers in time “of public peril or disaster.” The
other statutes provide for existing or anticipated emergencies attributable
to earthquake, flood, tornado, cyclone, hurricane, conflagration
and landslides.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p><em>Agricultural Pests</em>: A joint resolution of April 1937 made “funds
available for the control of incipient or emergency outbreaks of
insect pests or plant diseases, including grasshoppers, Mormon
crickets, and chinch bugs.”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Funds were appropriated on this authorization
later that month.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p><em>Famine</em>: The India Emergency Food Aid Act of 1951 provided
for emergency shipments of food to India to meet famine conditions
then ravaging the great Asian sub-continent.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> In August 1953<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Congress enacted general enabling legislation to permit the President
to furnish emergency assistance on behalf of the people of the United
States to friendly peoples in meeting famine or other urgent relief
requirements.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Thus the American Congress has sometimes defined
emergency in terms of occurrences in other countries.</p>


<h4>NATIONAL SECURITY EMERGENCIES</h4>

<p>These may be cataloged under the heads of (1) Neutrality, (2)
Defense, (3) Civil Defense, (4) Hostilities or War.</p>

<p><em>Neutrality Emergencies</em>: For a nation which, at least during the
1930s raised to the topmost position on its list of twentieth century
mistakes its involvement in the First World War, and which during
the same period embraced the policy of non-involvement in future
wars, the chief problem of national security was not so much to be
prepared for war or to avoid the occurrence of war, as it was, rather,
to stay out of other people’s wars, all wars being other people’s. The
existence of a war elsewhere in the world, especially one involving a
major power, creates the need for emergency action designed to avoid
the greatest of all emergencies, participation in a war. This is the
meaning of the Neutrality Act of 1935 and its successors. The import
thereof is embodied in the Presidential Proclamations which, under
the Neutrality Acts, proclaimed the existence of wars between states
or factions within states; but also the more important Proclamation
of September 8, 1939 which, without citing the acts, declared the
existence of a national emergency “to the extent necessary for proper
observance, safeguarding, and enforcing of the neutrality of the
United States and the strengthening of our national defense within
the limits of peacetime authorizations.”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Neutrality doctrine, oriented
as this was, contained the seeds of a more aggressive policy, and it was
appropriate that the President should phrase his May 27, 1941 declaration
of an unlimited national emergency as an enlargement upon the
earlier Proclamation. The President declared that an unlimited
national emergency confronting the country required that its military,
naval, air and civilian defenses be placed in a condition of
readiness to repel any and all acts or threats of aggression directed
toward any part of the Western Hemisphere.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The need was now for
adequate preparation rather than insulation. President Roosevelt’s
forthright statement of the Nation’s security requirements left
little doubt that we had passed from neutrality to all-out preparedness
as a national policy. For the security of this Nation and Hemisphere,
we should pass from peacetime authorizations of military strength<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
to whatever basis was needed to protect this entire hemisphere against
invasion, encirclement or penetration by foreign agents.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The concept
of neutrality dominant for a few years had been superseded by events.</p>

<p><em>Defense</em>: Many of the statutes directed at meeting the threat to
national survival posed by war are phrased in terms of the existence
of war or threat of war. Thus it is not rigidly possible to assign separate
pigeon-holes to those statutes which explicitly or by inference
define emergency in terms of the need for defense preparedness, and
those which define emergency in terms of the need for response to
existing hostilities. The 1951 amendments to the Universal Military
Training and Service, like the 1940 Act,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> by inference suggest that
military emergency is not related solely to the existence of hostilities.
The President is authorized under the statute “from time to time,
whether or not a state of war exists, to select and induct for training
in the National Security Training Corps ... such number of persons
as may be required....”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The Interior Department Appropriation
Act for fiscal 1948 included provision for cases of emergency caused
by fire, flood, storm, act of God, or sabotage.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> One cannot draw too
sharp a distinction between war and peace; an act of sabotage is as
likely as fire, flood, storm, or act of God. An Act of November 1940
launches upon an extensive list of national-defense material and
national-defense premises—so comprehensive as to include anything
whatsoever associated with defense production or transportation,
including public utilities—and lists punishments for the willful
injury or destruction of war material, or of war premises.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> And
following the war, it must be made clear that the emergency and the
need for emergency action continue. The war emergency has reverted
to a defense emergency. And so we turn to the First War Powers
Act of 1941 and revise it “by striking out the words ‘the prosecution of
the war effort’ and ‘the prosecution of the war’ and inserting the
words ‘the national defense’.”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p><em>Civil Defense</em>: By Proclamation, on October 22, 1941, having in
the spring of that year created an Office of Civilian Defense, President
Roosevelt indicated that among the facets of a war emergency might
be the endangering of civilian lives and property, and he invited all
persons throughout the nation to give thought to their duties and
responsibilities in the defense of this country, and to become better
informed of the many vital phases of the civilian defense program.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
The Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950 contemplated an attack or
series of attacks by an enemy of the United States which conceivably
would cause substantial damage or injury to civilian property or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
persons in the United States by any one of several means: sabotage,
the use of bombs, shellfire, or atomic, radiological, chemical, bacteriological,
or biological means or other weapons or processes.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Such
an occurrence would cause a “National Emergency for Civil Defense
Purposes,” or “a state of civil defense emergency,” during the term
which the Civil Defense Administrator would have recourse to extraordinary
powers outlined in the Act.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Powers and relationships set
up to effectuate response to a preparedness or civil defense emergency
are shortly seen to be convenient for application to any garden-variety
emergency which happens along, and so it is not surprising
to observe that arrangements created in anticipation of military
emergency are soon applied to natural catastrophes. The New York-New
Jersey Civil Defense Compact supplies an illustration in this
context for emergency cooperation. “‘Emergency’ as used in this
compact shall mean and include invasion or other hostile action,
disaster, insurrection or imminent danger thereof....”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p><em>Hostilities or War</em>: The Tariff Act of 1930<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> which has already
been cited a number of times in this chapter, permitted certain action
by the President whenever an emergency exists by reason of a state
of war, or otherwise. The Communications Act of 1934 and its 1951
amendment grant exceptional powers when there exists war or a
threat of war.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The 1940 National Defense Act amendments extended
enlistments in the Army in time of war or other emergency.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> The
May 1945 extension of the Selective Training and Service Act continued
it in effect for the duration of hostilities in the present war.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
And the threat seems the more intimate when the emergency is defined
in terms of enemies who have entered upon the territory of the
United States as part of an invasion or predatory incursion, ... to
commit sabotage, espionage or other hostile or warlike acts.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> The
1950 Emergency Detention Act<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> permits the President to declare
the existence of an Internal Security Emergency, upon the occurrence
of invasion, declaration of war by Congress, or insurrection within
the United States.</p>


<h4>PERCEIVING THE EXISTENCE OF AN EMERGENCY</h4>

<p>Congress is more than likely to delegate to the President power to
determine an emergency’s existence, sometimes providing him with
connotative definitions—such as “by reason of flood, earthquake,
or drought”—for guidance. It is particularly inclined to permit
the President to declare the termination of an emergency, frequently
hinging the life of an emergency statute to such a Presidential declaration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
or to the continuance of emergency previously proclaimed
by the President. But there is a growing tendency for the Congress to
grant contingent powers which may be exercised in the event of a
declaration of emergency either by Congress or the President, and
sometimes by Congress alone. We discuss elsewhere the growing
trend toward reservation to the Congress of power to terminate an
emergency through adoption of a concurrent resolution (which does
not require the President’s signature). The Emergency Detention
Act provision for declaration of an Internal Security Emergency,
mentioned above, hinges the presidential declaration, among other
things, to a prior Congressional declaration of war. Thus when
Congress has declared a war emergency to exist, the President, at his
discretion may declare the existence of an Internal Security Emergency
caused by the prospect of internal subversion. Congress,
perhaps, forecast the future trend of legislative-executive relations in
this field and in the adaptation of emergency action when in the
First Decontrol Act of 1947 it declared “in each ... limited instance
[that it is necessary to continue emergency controls in effect] the
authority for such emergency controls and war powers should not
be exercised by the grant of broad, general war powers but should
be granted by restrictive, specific legislation.”<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Conclusion</span></h3>

<p>It may be seen that a varied assortment of situations threatening
the economic interests of groups, the life and limb of the populace,
or the physical integrity of the nation itself, have been defined as
emergencies in the United States. The spread lies between a liquid
sugar or codfish emergency and an emergency caused by the global
military and ideological activities of the communist movement. The
citizen of the democratic state, having weathered depression, natural
disaster, agricultural, defense and war emergencies, and recognizing
that by popular consensus he lives in a time of cold war emergency
which may turn into a war emergency, or if lessened, may create an
emergency by virtue of the threat to continued prosperity resulting
from curbed defense orders, is entitled to be apprehensive.</p>

<p>The variety is so great, the invocation of emergency so ready that
one must ask whether the term is not becoming shorn of meaning—a
shibboleth for the legitimization of ordinarily suspect governmental
action desired by influential groups. Shibboleth or not, the individual
citizen, as we shall see subsequently, finds that its incantation is associated
with increasing constrictions upon his freedom of action.</p>

</div>


<p>Constitutional democracies as well as authoritarian states are
confronted in time of military crisis with the need for a maximum
productive and military effort directed at national survival.
Totalitarian nations in their practice of total absorption of the
materials and energies of conquered nations, and the Western democracies
in their insistence upon “unconditional surrender” have
contributed to the transformation of modern war from a struggle for
limited objectives to a struggle for survival.</p>

<p>The initial response of Great Britain in the First World War indicated
an assumption that war imposed upon a nation the necessity to
adapt the machinery of the government, and especially its military
arm, to the attainment of victory. Twentieth century wars, like those
of the Nineteenth century, were to be fought by the military. In terms
of the total national energies, war represented a temporary, localized
diversion. Democracies continue to manifest a not necessarily unhealthy
predisposition, even in the atomic age, to treat war as a subsidiary
effort which should not unduly ripple the accustomed habits
and interests of the major segment of the population and economy.
War is fought by governments, not by peoples. True, perhaps, in
regard to police actions which constitute occasional escape valves for
aggressive energies which might otherwise erupt in world war, this
aphorism which is maintained as a fiction in time of major war, is a
residue of an earlier and simpler age.</p>

<p>However tentative their initial response to World War II, the
Western democracies soon came to regard it as imposing the need
not simply to adapt governmental structure to the major purpose
of victory, but to maintain consistency between the political and
economic activities of individuals and this overriding goal. Exercising
a frankly coercive power, governments in the Second World War
conscripted the energies of individuals. Great Britain imposed a
labor draft as well as a military draft. The United States, resisting
nationwide demands for conscription of labor, satisfied itself with commanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
the military services of individuals. Both countries identified
individuals whom, it seemed, could best be integrated in the war effort
by being integrated <em>out</em> of it—<i lang="la">i.e.</i>, potential saboteurs, espionage
agents, and the like. However adequate or inadequate the techniques
for measuring individual and group loyalty, the measurement was
undertaken and thousands found themselves immobilized behind
barbed wires.</p>

<p>A person naive in political and human relations or a government
facing nascent revolution would resort solely to the technique of
command and coercion to secure the adjustment of individual goals
and efforts to those of the nation. Thus in the United States many
war programs depended upon the offering of incentives or simple
exhortation and appeal to individual loyalty for their effectiveness.
And, in a democracy it remains true in time of war as in peacetime,
that the essential nature of the political process is “the translation of
conflict among interest groups into authoritative decision.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>These are the conditions under which statutes and presidential
proclamations relating to the mobilization of the human resources
of the nation will be discussed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Positive Integration</span></h3>

<p><em>Civilian Labor Force</em>: Notwithstanding the failure of the United
States to adopt a form of outright labor conscription in the last war,
a number of statutory provisions did attempt to integrate segments
of the labor force more closely in the war effort. Those which were
primarily repressive in nature—i.e., which principally concerned
the imposition of penalties or the prohibition of specified activities—are
treated in the second section of this chapter.</p>

<p>In June 1939, Congress set up a program for the training of civil
aircraft pilots.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The Navy Department Appropriations Act for fiscal
1941<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> included an emergency fund to enable the President, among
other things, to procure and train civilian personnel necessary in
connection with the production of critical and essential items of
equipment and material and the use or operation of such equipment
and material. A month later, Congress authorized the Secretary of
War, during the period of any national emergency declared by the
President, to employ laborers and mechanics in excess of forty hours
per week, at time and one-half for overtime.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Another 1940 law
suspended during the national emergency statutory provisions imposing
the eight hour day for Maritime Commission contractors.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Section 801 of the Second War Powers Act of 1942 authorized the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
President to direct the assignment of Civilian Conservation Corps
manpower to protect the munitions, aircraft, and other war industries,
municipal water supply, power, and other utilities, and to protect
resources subject to the hazards of forest fires.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>Emergency conditions may lead to relaxation of the traditional
American rule, based upon the assumption that public employment
is a privilege and upon security grounds, that aliens are ineligible
for governmental positions—especially positions in the military
establishments. In 1946 Congress suspended statutory provisions
prohibiting the employment of aliens.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Thus the Secretary of the
Navy could authorize the Navy Department to employ non-citizens
whose special technical or scientific knowledge or experience would
be of benefit to the military services of the United States. The
wisdom of this legislation may be more readily appreciated when it
is remembered that German rocket experts like Dr. Werner von
Braun were able to serve in the United States rather than behind the
Iron Curtain. Similarly, as illustrated by the Selective Service Act
of 1948,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> effective mobilization of the labor force requires exemption
of some specially skilled persons from military conscription. This
Act authorized the President to provide for the deferment from
training and service certain categories of individuals in many different
fields as found to be necessary to the maintenance of the national
health, safety, or interest.</p>

<p>Work stoppages are the nemesis of any defense production program.
The wartime efforts to prevent or speedily terminate such stoppages
are reported in the next section, on the theory that they were
primarily coercive in nature. The Defense Production Act of 1950,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
however, clearly reflects the statutory trend in the United States
against the outlawing of strikes in time of emergency. Section 502
of the Act emphasizes that national policy is to place primary reliance
upon the parties to any labor dispute to settle their differences through
negotiation and collective bargaining, making full use of available
mediation and conciliation facilities. All settlements should be made
in the national interest. The President is to initiate strike settlement
conferences, with representatives of the public present, but no action
inconsistent with the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 may
be taken.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>Current information on the availability of essential skills must be
maintained. The National Science Foundation Act of 1950 included
among the functions of the agency that of maintaining a register of
scientific and technical personnel and providing a central clearinghouse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
for information covering all scientific and technical personnel
in the United States.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p><em>The Military Services</em>: Maintenance on active duty or in reserve
status of armed forces components adequate to the defense of the
United States is of continuing concern to the government. It is not
alone in time of war that attention is given to the adequacy of the
military services. Thus the 1930’s witnessed a series of amendments
to the 1916 National Defense Act designed to improve the status of
the reserve components of the Army. In June 1933, during the
famous first hundred days of the Roosevelt administration, it was
not too preoccupied with depression legislation to secure legislation
introducing changes into procedures for establishing National Guard
policy. All policies and regulations affecting the organization, training
and distribution of the National Guard were to be prepared by
committees of appropriate branches or divisions of the War Department
General Staff.</p>

<p>The Guard would be entitled to equal representation with the
Regular Army in formulating Guard policies, but the paramount
fact was that of federal supervision and integration of the National
Guard.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Further, the President was empowered to determine the
number of reserve officers in the various grades to be appointed to
the Officers’ Reserve Corps, and to make such appointments, subject
to Senatorial approval for ranks above Colonel.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> This is a characteristic
extension of the president’s power as Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>Two years later, in June 1935, a further amendment to the 1916
statute gave the President authority in an emergency at any time to
order officers of the National Guard to active duty for the duration
of the emergency, with the proviso, however, that no officer could be
employed on active duty for more than fifteen days in any calendar
year without his own consent.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Later that year the President was
authorized to call annually one thousand Reserve Officers (mostly
R.O.T.C. graduates) for a year’s active duty with the Regular Army
in the grade of second lieutenant. Only those who applied and who
had been screened by the War Department were eligible.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>Continuing to elaborate amendments to the National Defense Act,
Congress, in April 1938, established the requirement that line officers
should not be detailed to or remain as members of the General Staff
Corps unless two of their immediately preceding six years had been
served in actual command of or on duty other than General Staff
duty, with troops of one or more of the combatant arms or as instructor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
with the National Guard, Organized Reserves, or Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Two days later in another amendment to
the basic act, Congress provided for establishment of a Regular Army
Reserve, membership in which was restricted to persons under 36
years of age who had served in the Regular Army and from which
an honorable discharge had been received.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The Regular Army
Reserve was subject to call to active duty by the President in case
of emergency declared by him. Within six months after the termination
of an emergency declared by the President, the Reserve forces
were to be placed in an inactive status or discharged, whichever was
the more appropriate.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>In June 1938 the 1916 statute was amended to increase the allowed
strength of enlisted men in the Army Air Corps from 16,000 to
21,500.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> That same month an earlier Naval Reserve statute (Act of
February 28, 1925) was superseded and a Naval Reserve to consist
of the Fleet Reserve, the Organized Reserve, the Merchant Marine
Reserve, and the Volunteer Reserve was created. All were to constitute
a component part of the Navy.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> The same Act also provided for
a Marine Corps Reserve.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The reserve units were to be composed of
persons transferred, enlisted, or appointed to them.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>But it is in 1940 that the statute books commence to reflect administration
and congressional anticipation of American participation in
the War and the attendant necessity to compel individuals to give
military service. On May 14, 1940 provision was made for the extension
of all enlistments in the active military service for the
duration, plus six months in the event of war or other emergency
declared by Congress.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> The Secretary of the Navy was given power,
six days following Pearl Harbor, to extend for the duration of the war
plus six months all enlistments in the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast
Guard.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Another enactment of that date permitted the similar
extension of Army service.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> This Act also eliminated all territorial
restrictions on the use of units and members of the Army.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>Congress, having made provision for the extension of regular service
enlistments for the duration in the event of emergency, then granted
the President authority to call the reserve to active duty. This was
accomplished in August 1940 when Congress delegated to the President
power until June 30, 1942 to order into the active military service
for a twelve month period any or all members and units of any or all
reserve components of the Army of the United States, and retired
personnel of the Regular Army, with or without their consent, in any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
manner the President deemed necessary for the strengthening of the
national defense.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The August statute having empowered the
President to order the National Guard, as well as other reserve units,
into active duty, it seemed desirable to equip the States with authority
to set up military units for home duty in the absence of the Guard.</p>

<p>An October 1940 statute accomplished this purpose by authorizing
the states, while any part of the National Guard of the state concerned
was in active federal service, to organize and maintain whatever
military forces other than National Guard were believed necessary
by the state.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> These forces were subject to the Secretary of War’s
regulation on matters of discipline and training. They were not
subject to federal call, but neither were individual members exempt
by reason of service in such units from military service under any
federal law. In September 1950, three months after outbreak of the
Korean War, Congress authorized the President to call up reserve
forces and retired personnel from all military branches, with or without
the consent of those called.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> And, as in the Second World War, state
authorities were again empowered to set up military units to substitute
for the National Guard as long as any part of the National Guard
was in active federal service.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the gradual inclusion of compulsory service provisions
in statutes was carried to its ultimate conclusion in the Selective
Training and Service Act of 1940.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The Act required the registration
of all male citizens of the United States and male alien residents
between the ages of 21 and 36.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The President was authorized from
time to time, whether or not a state of war existed, to select and
induct into the land and naval forces of the United States for training
and service whatever number of men in his judgment might be required
for such forces in the national interest.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> A peacetime ceiling
of 900,000 inductees was established, and provision made for a twelve
months’ maximum training period subject to extension whenever the
Congress declared that the national interest was imperiled.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The
remaining powers granted to the President in the Act, and the limitations
which circumscribed his exercise of them, will be discussed in
other contexts.</p>

<p>By proclamation that day, and on October 1, 8, and November 12,
the President established registration days in the United States proper,
Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Alaska.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> A second registration day was
proclaimed in May 1941, and a third on January 5, 1942.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> The
Conscription Act was continued in effect for the duration of the war.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
A post-war, or “cold war”, conscription program was set up in June
1948.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> The new statute provided for the registration of male citizens
and alien residents between the ages of 18 and 26, and made those
between 19 and 26 subject to induction into the armed forces at the
discretion of the President.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> He was empowered to induct a sufficient
number of persons to maintain the personnel strengths of the armed
forces at three million men.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The maximum term of service was two
years, and the Act’s duration was set at two years. A September
1950 amendment to the Act allowed the President to require special
registration of medical, dental, and allied specialties, drafting persons
below the age of 50 from the lists to fill requisitions submitted by the
Department of Defense and approved by the President.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> An eleventh
hour enactment of June 23, 1950 deferred expiration of the Selective
Service Act for fifteen days,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and seven days later July 9, 1951 was
substituted for the July 9, 1950 expiration date.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>The next year saw systematic amendment of the 1948 statute,
including a change of title to the Universal Military Training and
Service Act.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The maximum of two years’ service was continued,
and the minimum age for both registration and induction set at <span class="nowrap">18 <span class="fnum">1</span>/<span class="fden">2</span></span>
years. A 1953 amendment to the Act provided for the special registration,
classification, and induction of medical, dental, and allied
specialist personnel.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> A method for gaining release from military
service, anachronistic in the age of universal military service and
the citizen army, was removed when in July 1953 Congress repealed
provisions of 1890 and 1893 statutes which permitted enlisted men
to purchase discharge from the armed services.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>A series of non-coercive statutes from 1939 on were designed to
augment the armed services. In June 1939 Congress established a
Coast Guard Reserve, composed of owners of motorboats and
yachts.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> In March 1941 the President was empowered to appoint
within the Navy 100 acting assistant surgeons above previous quotas,
and the Secretary of the Navy given power in time of war or national
emergency declared by the President to appoint for temporary service,
such acting assistant surgeons as the exigencies of the service
required.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>A June 1942 statute suspended all limitations on personnel strength
in the military services.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Upon emergence of the “Cold War” Congress
again authorized increases in military strength. In April 1946 the
Navy and Marine Corps were permitted to increase the number of
commissioned officers on the active list, and to maintain enlisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
strength at 500,000 for the Regular Navy, and at 200,000 for the
Marine Corps.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> A Civil Air Patrol, to serve as a volunteer civilian
auxiliary to the Air Force, was established in May 1948.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The Air
Force was to establish, maintain, supply, and equip liaison offices
with the CAP, and to detail Air Force military and civilian personnel
to assist in training CAP members. Not dissimilar to the provision
establishing the CAP as a civilian adjunct to the Air Force was a
1953 statute authorizing the President to employ the American
National Red Cross under the Armed Forces whenever the President
found it necessary to order such employment.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>The Women’s Armed Services Integration Act of June 1948 integrated
the women’s services as Regular units within the Army, Navy,
Marine Corps, and Air Force.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Four years later Congress authorized
the appointment of qualified women as physicians and specialists in
the medical services of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> In 1950
provision was made for the five year enlistment in the Regular Army
of 2,500 qualified unmarried male aliens.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Alien enlistees were integrated
into established units with citizen soldiers and not segregated
into separate organizations for aliens.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Negative Integration</span></h3>

<p>It has become an axiom of democratic government that in time of
emergency threatening the health or safety of the community or the
territorial integrity of the nation, the objective of communal survival
takes precedence over the desires and conveniences of the individual.
The energies, wealth, talents of individuals may be conscripted in the
national interest. Democratic governments also have asserted the
right to constrict the range of permissible activities of individuals
whose freedom, if unlimited, is calculated to exacerbate the emergency.
Such limitations may apply to the population generally or to defined
segments of it. The intensity of such limitations may be measured on
a continuum ranging from precautionary detention to the relatively
mild requirement that persons in defined categories register with the
government.</p>

<p><em>Preventive Detention</em>: At an early date Congress, with judicial
approval, exercised the power to apprehend and detain all enemy
aliens. On December 7, 1941, President Roosevelt issued the first of
ten wartime proclamations founded upon Congressional enactments
of 1798 and 1918, imposing limitations upon the activities of enemy
aliens, and specifically announcing that “All aliens shall be liable to
restraint, or to give security,”<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> and that dangerous aliens might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
subjected to arrest and confinement. In two statutes enacted in 1952,
Congress reiterated its desire that illegal entrants be apprehended
and detained pending deportation. These statutes provided for the
search of vessels and arrest of persons seeking to enter the United
States illegally,<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> and authorized the establishment of necessary detention
facilities to hold those arrested.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>It is well known that in World War II persons of Japanese ancestry,
including even those possessed of American citizenship, were subjected
to preventive detention.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Presidential exercise of this form of restraint
is now sanctioned on a standby basis. Title II of the Internal
Security Act of 1950 empowers the President in time of “Internal
Security Emergency” to order the apprehension and detention of
persons “as to whom there is reasonable ground to believe that,” if
free, they “will engage in, or probably will conspire with others to
engage in, acts of espionage or of sabotage.”<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The President may
declare a state of internal security emergency upon the invasion of
the United States or any of its territories or possessions, the declaration
of war by Congress, or insurrection within the United States in
aid of a foreign enemy.</p>

<p><em>Access to the U.S. and U.S. Citizenship</em>: Closely related to the
detention of enemy aliens or others whose liberty is perceived to endanger
the security of the state is the control of access to the United
States and the acquisition of United States citizenship. By Act of
June 20, 1941<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Congress instructed American diplomatic and consular
officers to refuse visas or entry permits to aliens believed seeking entry
into the United States for the purpose of engaging in activities which
would endanger the public safety. The following day Congress
granted the President power during the existing national emergency
to place restrictions and prohibitions in addition to those already
provided by law upon the departure of persons from and their entry
into the United States.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> In proclamations of July and September
1945 and April 1946, President Truman ordered the deportation of
enemy aliens resident in the United States without admission under
the immigration laws, or enemy aliens deemed dangerous to the public
peace and safety of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>In an earlier statute Congress excluded from admission to the
United States persons who have departed from the jurisdiction of the
United States for the purpose of evading or avoiding training or
service in the armed forces of the United States during time of war
or during a period declared by the President to be a period of national
emergency. Among the myriad restrictions of the Internal Security<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Act of 1950 are to be found additional categories of aliens ineligible
for entry into the United States, principally aliens who at any time
have been members of the Communist or other totalitarian party of
any state of the United States, of any foreign state, or of any political
or geographical subdivision of any foreign state, and aliens who
advocate the economic, international, and governmental doctrines
of world communism or of any form of totalitarianism.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>Naturalization is refused or citizenship withdrawn from persons
falling into classifications created by a security-conscious Congress.
The Nationality Act of 1940<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> restricted the eligibility of alien enemies
for nationalization to those whose declaration of intention was made
not less than two years prior to the beginning of the state of war and
specified that enemy aliens were eligible for apprehension and removal
at any time previous to actual naturalization. Section 25 of the
Internal Security Act amends the Nationality Act of 1940 to make
ineligible for naturalization persons subscribing to or giving evidence
of subscribing to anarchist, communist, or any totalitarian movement
or body of sentiment. Those who within the ten years next preceding
the filing of naturalization petitions, or in the period between such
filing and the time of taking the final oath of citizenship, have been
members of, or affiliated with, communist-front organizations registered
under the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, must
rebut a presumption that they are persons not attached to the
principles of the Constitution and thus ineligible for citizenship.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>Congress has devised appropriate means for handling the cases of
persons seeking to renounce American citizenship. To facilitate the
surrender of United States citizenship by persons of Japanese ancestry,
Congress in July, 1944, specified that with the permission of
the Attorney General, and when the United States is at war, citizens
may accomplish expatriation by the simple act of making in the
United States a formal written renunciation of nationality in such
form as may be prescribed by, and before an officer designated by the
Attorney General.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The assumption that persons departing from or
remaining outside of the jurisdiction of the United States in time of
war for the purpose of evading or avoiding military service renounce
their American citizenship was created by an Act of Congress in
September, 1944.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>President Roosevelt by proclamation of July 1941 provided for
establishment of “The Proclaimed List of Certain Blocked Nationals”
to be published in the Federal Register. The list was to contain the
names of those persons deemed to be, or to have been, acting on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
behalf of the interests of Germany and Italy. Any material or article
exported from the United States through the efforts of German and
Italian “blocked nationals” was declared to be detrimental to the
interest of national defense in the United States.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> The Secretary
of State, acting in conjunction with the Secretary of the Treasury,
the Attorney General, the Secretary of Commerce, the Administrator
of Export Control, and the Coordinator of Commercial and Cultural
Relations between the American Republics was required to prepare
the list.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>Persons naturalized after January 1, 1951 created a <i lang="la">prima facie</i>
case that they were not attached to the principles of the Constitution
of the United States at the time of naturalization, if within five years
after naturalization they joined as a member or affiliated with any
organization, attachment to which would have precluded or hindered
naturalization in the first place. The unwary risked cancellation of
his citizenship for fraud if found to be connected with an organization
whose goals and objectives were directed against the United States.
This is one of the Internal Security Act provisions<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> designed to
exclude communists from naturalization. The Expatriation Act of
1954 provides for the loss of nationality of persons (whether natural
born or naturalized citizens) convicted by a court or court martial
of committing treason against the United States, or engaging in a
conspiracy to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government
of the United States, or to levy war against them.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p><em>Circumscribing Movement of Persons</em>: The area of permissible
mobility is narrowed for all persons in time of war or emergency. The
population generally is excluded from specified security areas. By
Act of January, 1938,<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Congress authorized the President to define
certain vital military and naval installations or equipment and made
it unlawful to photograph or sketch such installations without proper
authority. This obviously limits access to and activity in areas adjacent
to such equipment. A 1950 amendment to the Civil Aeronautics
Act, for example, empowered the Secretary of Commerce,
after consultation with the Department of Defense and the Civil
Aeronautics Board, to define zones or areas in the airspace above
the United States, its Territories, and possessions as he may find
necessary in the interests of national security. The Secretary is also
given authority to prohibit or restrict flights of aircraft which he
cannot effectively identify, locate, and control in those areas.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
Selected groups of persons, generally enemy aliens, may be prohibited
from entering or remaining in certain areas of the country. Proclamation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
No. 2525, December 7, 1941,<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> forbade the presence of alien
Japanese in the Canal Zone, and restricted their entry into, or departure
from, Hawaii, the Philippine Islands, and the United States,
and provided for their exclusion from designated areas. Of maximum
severity were limitations on mobility beyond the limits of a community,
or confinement in a camp or cell. The movement to restrict
travel by Americans dates from the 1935 endeavor of the American
Congress to avoid American involvement in any future conflict.
Section 6 of the Neutrality Act of 1935<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> empowered the President
to prohibit or regulate travel by American citizens as passengers on
the vessels of any belligerents in a war in which the United States was
a neutral. Individuals travelling in violation of orders did so at
their own risk.</p>

<p>Two months after passage of the Neutrality Act, in October 1935,
President Roosevelt issued Proclamation No. 2142, applying Section
6 to the Ethiopian conflict, and ordering American citizens to refrain
from traveling as passengers on vessels of either belligerent. The
May 1937 amendments to the Neutrality Act<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> strengthened this
provision by making it unlawful for any United States citizen to
travel on belligerent vessels in contravention of the President’s
prohibition or regulation of such travel. In 1939 these provisions
were broadened to include any American travelling on such a vessel
as a member of its crew,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> and to prohibit American ships from
carrying goods or passengers to belligerent ports<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> or combat areas.</p>

<p>President Roosevelt’s Neutrality Proclamation of September 5,
1939, among other things, prohibited Americans from accepting commissions
with belligerents, or enlisting in the service of a belligerent.
Hiring persons to enlist, or going beyond the jurisdiction of the United
States with the intent to join belligerent forces, were also prohibited.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>By Act of March 28, 1940,<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Congress extended application of an
earlier prohibition<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> on unauthorized entry on military reservations
to the outlying possessions of the United States. A year later it
granted the Secretaries of War and Navy, jointly or singly, power to
define areas within such reasonable distance of any military or naval
camp or station in which prostitution would be prohibited by federal
law.</p>

<p>By Proclamation of December 27, 1941 President Roosevelt
established the Hawaiian Maritime Control Area, and regulated
entry, radio calls, visual communications, and traffic in that area.
Naval authorities were granted power to establish supplementary
regulation.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Subsequently, the President established Maritime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Control Areas for Cristobal and the Gulf of Panama,<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Boston,<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> San
Francisco, Columbia River, Puget Sound, Southeastern Alaska, and
other areas.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> On May 20, 1942, invoking his powers as Commander-in-Chief,
the President established the Padre Island Sea Range Area,
and imposed regulations controlling entry to an activity in that
area. The next day he signed into law an enactment providing a
maximum penalty of $5,000 fine and one year imprisonment for
knowingly violating restrictions established by the President, the
Secretary of War, or military commanders designated by him, on
entering, remaining in, leaving, or committing proscribed acts in
military areas or zones.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>The areas thus far described were defined principally for exclusionary
purposes. It is not unusual to define areas with a view to
confining therein specific persons or categories of persons. Invoking
a 1909 statute, the President on September 5, 1939 made it illegal
for interned members of the armed forces of belligerent nations to
leave the jurisdiction of the United States, or the limits of their
internment, without permission.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> In a later proclamation the President
stipulated that no alien would be permitted to depart from the
United States if the Secretary of State were satisfied that the alien’s
departure would be prejudicial to the interests of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>Section 6 of the Internal Security Act of 1950 makes it illegal for
members of an organization which has registered under the Act as
a communist organization or has been ordered to do so by the Subversive
Activities Control Board, to apply for a passport, or to use
or attempt to use a passport. It is also an offense for a federal officer
knowingly to issue a passport to such a person. The Immigration
and Nationality Act also empowers the President, in time of war or
national emergency, to impose restrictions and prohibitions upon the
departure of persons from the United States.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p><em>Registration</em>: The requirement that specified categories of individuals
register, in consequence of their backgrounds, associations,
or activities, or as a result of possession of certain articles, becomes
increasingly familiar in the United States. Legislative motivation
in requiring such registration may be varied and complex. The
registration provision invariably provides the basis for defining new
crimes and therefore opportunity to prosecute persons whose backgrounds,
activities and beliefs are anathema to powerful groups in
the nation. Combined with periodic reporting, registration may act
as a deterrent to the commission of certain acts considered socially
or politically undesirable. It may simply facilitate the informative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
function of government, enabling authorities to become aware of
and continuously check upon the activities of selected groups of
persons affecting the public interest. Or, registration may serve as a
mild, yet nonetheless effective, restraint upon the freedom of individuals.
Certainly, for example, it is an essential prerequisite to paroling
enemy aliens in time of war, although its usefulness is not limited to
wartime only.</p>

<p>The decade prior to the Second World War is popularly, and
accurately, perceived as one of sustained economic emergency.
During the second half of this decade the Congress frequently was
preoccupied with the need for legislation designed to protect the
United States from involvement in another world war. The Neutrality
Act of 1935<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> referred to above contained a registration feature.
Under the terms of that Act, every person engaged in the business
of manufacturing, exporting, or importing any arms, ammunition, and
implements of war was required to register within ninety days of
entering such a business. Such individuals or firms had to provide
the Secretary of State with a $500 registration fee, and information
including personal or business name, principal place of business,
places of business in the United States, and a list of the arms, ammunition
and other implements of war which they handled. They
were also required to inform the Secretary of State of any changes,
and had to keep permanent records of business transactions which
were subject to the scrutiny of the National Munitions Control Board.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
The registration provision was retained in the May 1937 amendment
to the Neutrality Act with very little change.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>In June 1938 Congress chose to compel registration of persons
employed by agencies to disseminate propaganda in the United
States.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Every person then acting as an agent for a foreign principal
was given thirty days after the Act went into effect to register with
the Secretary of State. His registration statement, under oath, required
the agent’s name and address, the name and address of his
principal, and a copy of the contract or oral agreement covering the
agent’s services, including compensation. The agent was also to file
a copy of the charter as well as a statement of the objectives of the
organization employing him.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> The term “agent of a foreign principal”
was rather broad and included any person who acted or engaged or
agreed to act as a public-relations counsel or publicity agent for a
foreign principal or for any domestic organization subsidized directly
or indirectly in whole or in part by a foreign principal.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> New information
statements were to be filed each six months. Failure to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
file and the making of false statements were punishable by a maximum
of $1,000 fine and two years’ imprisonment.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>Six months prior to Pearl Harbor, Congress enacted the Alien
Registration Act, requiring all aliens fourteen years of age or older
and remaining in the United States for thirty days or more, to apply
for registration and be fingerprinted at post offices and other places
to be designated by the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization.
Parents must register for aliens under fourteen.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Alien
registrants who were residents of the United States were required
to notify the Commissioner in writing of each change of residence
and new address within five days from the date of such change. All
others were to notify him of their addresses at the expiration of each
three months’ period of residence in the United States.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> And by
Proclamation No. 2537, January 14, 1942,<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> the President ordered
all alien enemies within the continental United States, Puerto Rico,
and the Virgin Islands to apply for and acquire certificates of
identification.</p>

<p>In the Spring of 1942 the Foreign Agents Registration Act was
adapted to changed conditions. Congress announced its purpose to
protect the national defense, internal security, and foreign relations
of the United States by requiring public disclosure by persons engaging
in propaganda activities and other activities. Anyone acting
for or on behalf of a foreign government, foreign political party or
other foreign principal would be identified and the Government and
the American people would be in a better position to appraise their
statements and actions in the light of their associations and activities.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
In addition to elaborating the definition of a foreign principal, the
Act specified numerous exemptions from its registration provisions.
Agents whose foreign principals were governments, the defense of
which was deemed by the President to be vital to the defense of the
United States, were not required to register provided their activities
were not intended to conflict with any of the domestic or foreign
policies of the Government of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>A related statute of October, 1940 also compelled certain groups
to register with the Attorney General.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Four categories of organizations
were required to register: (1) Organizations subject to foreign
control and engaging in political activity, (2) Organizations engaging
both in civilian-military activity and in political activity, (3) Those
subject to foreign control and engaging in civilian-military activity,
and (4) Any organization one of whose aims was the overthrow of a
government or subdivision thereof by force or violence.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> By political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
activity Congress had reference to activity aimed at the control by
force or overthrow of the Government of the United States or any of
its subdivisions.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> An organization, according to the statute, was
engaged in civilian-military activity if it gave or received instruction
in the use of firearms or other weapons, or participated, with or
without arms, in military maneuvers, drills or parades of a military or
naval character. And an organization was deemed subject to foreign
control if its financial support was derived directly or indirectly from
a foreign government, or if its policy was determined by, or at the
suggestion of, or in collaboration with, a foreign government.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>The registration statements were to contain the name and address
of the organization, the names of officers and contributors, the qualifications
for membership, organizational aims, assets, income, and
activities. Violation of the Act might entail a fine of $10,000 and five
years’ imprisonment.</p>

<p>The Internal Security Act of 1950 contains provisions similar to
the older wartime law. Briefly stated, the Act defines “communist-action”
and “communist-front” organizations, which together comprise
a class of communist organizations.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Such organizations are
compelled to register with the Attorney General, filing, in the case of
communist-front organizations, a list of officers at time of registration
and in the preceding twelve months; and, in the case of communist-action
organizations, a list of officers and members for the preceding
twelve months.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> A complete financial accounting is required and
current information must be supplied in annual reports.</p>

<p>In July 1954 Congress amended the reporting provision to require a
listing, in such form and detail as the Attorney General might prescribe,
of all printing presses and machines used or intended to be
used by a communist-action or communist-front organization. The
statute went so far as to require registration of any printing machine
used by an organization in which the communists or affiliates had an
interest.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Adequate procedural protection and provision for judicial
review is afforded those charged with failure to register.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>The Communist Control Act of 1954 amplified the Internal Security
Act. It purports to be an Act to outlaw the Communist Party and
to prohibit members of communist organizations from serving in
certain representative capacities, and for other purposes. Despite
its title, the Act does not outlaw the Communist Party in the sense
of making membership in it illegal and proscribing its existence. It
simply deprives the Communist Party of certain rights, privileges and
immunities attendant upon legal bodies created under the jurisdiction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
of the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
The Act then defines a new species within the genus communist
organization.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> In effect it amends the Internal Security Act by setting
up the trilogy; communist-action, communist-front, and
communist-infiltrated organizations. And communist-infiltrated
organizations—a euphemism for communist dominated trade unions
must register.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Such organizations are ineligible to act as collective
bargaining representatives and are deprived of access to the National
Labor Relations Board.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>The Act makes it illegal for any member of a communist organization,
which either has registered with the Attorney General or been
ordered to register by the Subversive Activities Control Board, “to
hold office or employment with any labor organization, ... or to
represent any employer in any matter proceeding arising or pending
under the National Labor Relations Act.”<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

<p><em>Freedom of Association</em>: The Communist Control Act of 1954 and
the registration provisions of the Internal Security Act might well
have been subsumed under the classification freedom of association.
Both have grave implications for the freedom of individuals to associate
at will and according to conscience with political and economic
groups. And similarly far-reaching in implication for this traditional
freedom are those provisions which, going one step further than
stipulating disqualifications for office-holding in representative associations,
prohibit the creation of an employer-employee relationship,
or facilitate the disruption of such relationships where they already
exist.</p>

<p>The wheel has taken a full turn since the American Congress in
1937 repealed a District of Columbia Appropriation Act provision
that no part of any appropriation for the public schools would be
available for the payment of the salary of any person teaching or
advocating communism.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Today, of course, the trend is toward
maximizing the political disqualifications for public and private
employment. This trend can be traced from the pre-war efforts of
the Congress to prevent penetration of defense industries and government
agencies by subversives.</p>

<p>We look first to legal efforts to exclude persons conceived to be subversive
from private employment, and then survey the statutes
governing public employment. The Defense Production Act of June
21, 1940,<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> for example, imposed the rule that aliens working for a
defense contractor whose contract involved access to classified information
were ineligible to work for the contractor. If, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
the head of the government agency for whom secret work was being
performed gave the contractor written consent to use aliens, the contractor
was free to do so.</p>

<p>Attempting to insure that employment opportunities created by the
induction of young men into the service did not accrue to members
of groups then opposing the American defense effort, Congress, in
enacting the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, stipulated
that whenever a vacancy was caused in the employment rolls of any
business or industry by reason of an employee’s induction into the
Armed Services of the United States, the vacancy could not be filled
by any person then a member of the Communist Party or the German-American
Bund.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Ten days after Pearl Harbor, restraints were
placed on the liberty of maritime employers to hire radio operators
for service on American flag vessels. For the duration of war
emergency it became unlawful to employ any person to serve as
radio operator aboard any vessel (other than a vessel of foreign
registry) if the Secretary of the Navy (1) had disapproved such
employment for any specified voyage, route, or area of operation,
and (2) had notified the master of the vessel of such disapproval
prior to the vessel’s departure.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p>Since the war, no less significant prohibitions have been placed on
public or private employment of members of communist organizations.
The effect thereof will be determined by the success of the
Subversive Activities Control Board in compelling the registration
of such groups. Section 5 of the Internal Security Act of 1950 makes
it illegal for members of registered communist organizations to conceal
or fail to disclose such membership in seeking or accepting any employment
in any defense facility, as defined and listed by the Secretary
of Defense. This provision was extended to make illegal defense
employment for members of registered “Communist action” groups.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>It may be noted that the Butler Bill of April 1955 would have
empowered the President to establish procedures for screening any
person in defense employment “as to whom there is reasonable cause
to believe may engage in sabotage, espionage, or other subversive
acts.” This process of screening also would be applied to firms seeking
or holding defense contracts. Thus, increasingly access of private
firms to government contracts as well as access of individuals to jobs
under such contracts, which today may be the staff of life, is being
restricted. Contributing to this trend is the provision in the Rubber
Producing Facilities Disposal Act of 1953 that purchase proposals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
shall not be accepted from any person who has not identified his
principal, or is not financially responsible, or is a poor security risk.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p>Freedom of employees to strike defense industries or to engage
in so-called emergency strikes has on occasion been severely limited.
The War Labor Disputes Act of 1943 required that the government
be given notice of labor disputes, and that production continue for
a period of thirty days after notice of intention to strike. A secret
ballot of employees had to be conducted prior to calling a strike.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
The President was granted ultimate power to seize plants if necessary
to avoid interruption of war production occasioned by labor disputes,
and interference with government operation of such plants was made
illegal.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> The plants were to be operated under the terms and conditions
of employment which were in effect at the time possession
was taken by the government.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p>In the post-war Labor-Management Relations Act a national
emergency strike is defined as one imperiling “the national health
or safety.”<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> When, in the opinion of the President, a threatened or
existing strike or lockout affecting an entire industry or a substantial
part thereof imperils the national health or safety, he may appoint a
board of inquiry to inquire into the issues involved in the dispute and
to make a written report to him within such time as he shall prescribe.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
When the President has received a report from a board of inquiry,
he may direct the Attorney General to petition any district court of
the United States having jurisdiction of the parties to enjoin such
strike or lockout or its continuance, and if the court finds that a
threatened or actual strike or lockout (1) affects an entire industry or
a substantial part thereof engaged in trade, commerce, transportation,
transmission, or engaged in the production of goods for commerce; and
(2) if permitted to occur or to continue, will imperil the national
health or safety, it shall have jurisdiction to enjoin any such strike
or lockout.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>The President will be advised of such a strike or lockout sufficiently
in advance of its occurrence because Section 8 (d) of the Act requires
60 days’ written notice of termination or modification of a collective
bargaining contract, and notification of the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service and equivalent state or territorial services within
thirty days after such notice of the existence of a dispute.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>Looking to restrictions upon federal employment, it is convenient
to begin with 1940, the year in which, in an effort to expedite the
strengthening of the national defense, Congress gave the Secretary
of War limited power to remove army civil service employees for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
security reasons. The Secretary might remove from the classified civil
service of the United States any employee of the Military Establishment
forthwith if he found that such person had been guilty of conduct
inimical to the public interest in the defense program of the United
States, and if the person terminated had received notice of the
charges.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Discharged employees were given the opportunity within
thirty days of removal to answer charges in writing and to submit
affidavits in support of written answers.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>Great discretion was permitted the civilian heads of the armed
services in promoting or demoting regular officers during wartime,
and as early as July 29, 1941 the President signed a Joint Resolution
giving the Secretary of War power during the time of the national
emergency to remove any officer from the active list of the Regular
Army. The only restriction on the exercise of this power was that
a comparison of the officer’s performance-of-duty record with those
of his fellow officers would be made. But retention in or dismissal
from the active list, of any officer, ultimately could be determined
by the Secretary,<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> even though affected officers were guaranteed a
hearing before a board of not less than five general officers prior to
separation.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Supplementing this was the provision that no payment
could be made from money appropriated in the Act to any officer
on the retired list of the Army who, for himself or for others, was
engaged in the selling or the sale of any war materials or supplies
either to the Army or the War Department.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>Since 1950 it has become common practice for the Congress to
attach to appropriation bills the provision that no salary or wages
will be paid from any appropriation to an individual who either
asserts the right to strike against the Government or belongs to an
employees’ organization asserting this right. And no monies will be
paid to an individual who advocates or is a member of an organization
that advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United
States.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> The Defense Production Act of 1950 contained this type
of provision.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> It further provided that an affidavit shall be <i lang="la">prima
facie</i> evidence that the person making it has acted contrary to the
statute.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Agencies also have been delegated broad power to suspend
employees deemed security risks. An August, 1950 statute permitted
the heads of the State, Commerce, Defense, Justice, and Treasury
Departments, the Secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force, and
others, in their absolute discretion and when deemed necessary in
the interest of the national security, to suspend, without pay, any
civilian official or employee.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Following notice and an opportunity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
to the suspended employee to submit statements and affidavits, and
after investigation and review by the employing agency, his employment
might be terminated as necessary or advisable in the interest of
the national security. Since the employee is informed of the reasons
for his suspension only to the extent that such agency head determines
that the interests of the national security permit, he may encounter
difficulty in formulating his defense.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough while military emergency may be assigned as
justifiable for banning or terminating employment of persons on the
basis of their political affiliations, Congress has recognized that other
kinds of emergency may require temporary suspension of such disqualifications
to federal employment. The Department of Interior
Appropriation Act of 1948 provided that in cases of emergency,
caused by fire, flood, storm, act of God, or sabotage, persons might be
employed for periods of not more than thirty days and be paid
salaries and wages without the necessity of inquiring into their membership
in any organization.</p>

<p><em>Traditional Procedural Rights of Individuals</em>: Whether justifiable
or not, in time of crisis encroachment upon the traditional rights and
privileges of individuals invariably has been recorded. The Compulsory
Testimony Act of August, 1954<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> may be an example of such
legislation. It enables Congressional Committees in a limited number
of instances to solicit the courts in compelling testimony from recalcitrant
witnesses who have invoked their constitutional privilege
against self-incrimination. Suspension of this constitutional safeguard
is achieved by the immunity from prosecution accorded the witness
under the terms of this measure. As to the scope of the immunity
therein afforded, it is not in excess of that granted in laws previously
enacted, notably the following: Interstate Commerce Act, Sherman
Anti-Trust Act, Securities Exchange Act, Communications Act,
National Labor Relations Act, Motor Carrier Act, Federal Power
Act, Public Utility Holding Company Act, Industrial Alcohol Act,
Merchant Marine Act, Bituminous Coal Act, Natural Gas Act, Civil
Aeronautics Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Railroad Unemployment
Insurance Act, Social Security Act, Investment Company Act, Investment
Advisers Act, Second War Powers Act, and Emergency Price
Control Act, 1942. See a more extended listing in <cite>Shapiro</cite> v. <cite>U.S.</cite><a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>Emergency entails restraints upon the freedom of individuals to
manipulate their property and to act as they please. Not only does
the government, as has been noted, seize factories and mines, but can
compel acceptance of government orders.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter V</span>
<br><span class="cheaderfont">GOVERNMENTAL ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In recent years the federal government has set up programs for the
acquisition or disposition of productive facilities and natural resources.
These programs have had various objectives, as for example
the acquisition in conjunction with its parity payments policy of
surplus agricultural commodities. Later acquisition programs,
justified in terms of national defense, include the following: stockpiling
of strategic raw materials; acquisition of land and equipment for military
sites and for federally-owned productive facilities; the lending
or leasing of federally-owned productive equipment to private producers;
and the acquisition of plants and raw and finished materials
incidental to enforcement of emergency control programs.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Stockpiling</span></h3>

<p>The Government may acquire natural resources in an effort to stockpile
for defense purposes, in the course of expanding the military establishments
or governmentally owned productive facilities, or it may acquire
such resources to facilitate a privately financed defense project.
This last purpose sometimes leads the Government to lend its power of
eminent domain to private business concerns.</p>

<p>In June 1939 Congress assigned to the Secretary of the Interior
and the Army and Navy Munitions Board the task of determining
which materials are strategic and critical to American defense, and
provided for acquisition of stocks of these materials.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Congress also
encouraged the development of mineral resources within the United
States. Two months later Congress approved the exchange of surplus
agricultural commodities held by the Commodity Credit Corporation
for stocks of strategic and critical materials produced abroad.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> Under
the fiscal 1941 Appropriations Act, the Navy Department obtained
funds for procurement of strategic and critical materials in accordance
with the Act of June 7, 1939.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> In this statute, and in a July 1940 Act
to expedite the strengthening of the national defense, the President
also was authorized to expend large sums on acquisition of such
materials.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span></p>

<p>The Defense Production Act of 1950 empowers the President to
make provision either for purchases of, or commitments to purchase
metals and other raw materials, including liquid fuels. The government
may use the acquired items or offer them for resale. The same
Act also empowers the President to encourage the exploration, development,
and mining of critical and strategic minerals and metals.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
The Mutual Security Act of 1951 also provides sustenance for the
stockpiling program. The Director for Mutual Security is authorized
to initiate projects designed to increase production and help in obtaining
raw materials in which deficiencies exist among the United States’
free world allies. The purpose of aiding recipients of American aid to
develop their own stockpiling program of critical materials is to reduce
the steady drain on United States resources.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> The power of condemnation
was added to the power of requisitioning granted in the
1950 Defense Production Act when Congress in a 1951 amendment
empowered the President in the interest of national defense, and
when deemed necessary by him, to acquire materials needed by the
government. Acquisition may be by transfer, donation, purchase, or,
if needed, properly instituted judicial proceedings.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>The Domestic Minerals Program Extension Act of 1953 sought to
reduce American dependence on overseas sources of supply for strategic
or critical minerals and metals during periods of threatening world
conflict.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> This was to be accomplished through a united effort on the
part of each department and agency of the government having
responsibility for the discovery, development, production, and acquisition
of strategic or critical minerals and metals in order to decrease
further and to eliminate where possible the dependency of the United
States on overseas sources of supply of each such material.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> The Act
extended for an additional two years the termination dates of all
purchase programs designed to stimulate the domestic production of
tungsten, manganese, chromite, mica, asbestos, beryl, and columbium-tantalum-bearing
ores and concentrates and established by regulations
issued pursuant to the Defense Production Act of 1950.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Military Sites and Productive Facilities</span></h3>

<p>Scattered through the statute books, of course, are numerous
authorizations to defense agencies to acquire land for specific projects.
For example, a July 1939 statute authorized the Secretary of War
to acquire fourteen described plots,<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> and a May 1949 statute authorized
the Secretary of the Air Force to establish a joint long-range
proving ground for guided missiles and other weapons and to acquire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
lands and rights necessary to set up the project.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> An Act of 1951
authorized the Secretary of the Navy to enlarge existing water-supply
facilities for the San Diego, California area for the purpose of insuring
the existence of an adequate water supply for naval installations and
defense production plants in that area.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Of equal, if not greater
significance than the scope of the delegation contained therein are
the provisions for extension of Congressional control set-out in these
authorizations for acquisition of specific items.</p>

<p>In the Second War Powers Act, breadth of Congressional delegation
rather than intensity of control is the dominant fact. For example, the
President was authorized to permit the Secretaries of War and Navy,
or any other officer, board or commission, to acquire real property
by any means necessary, including condemnation, to insure its use
by the Government when needed.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> Immediate possession might be
taken after filing of a condemnation petition.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Among the many
powers granted to the Federal Civil Defense Administrator in the
1951 statute creating the FCDA was that of procuring by condemnation
or otherwise, constructing, or leasing materials and facilities.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a></p>

<p>Because they are extremely scarce or non-existent in their natural
state in the United States, a few elements or other commodities have
been the object of intensive government efforts to either directly
produce them on a full scale, or to encourage private production by
acquiring and transferring to private firms certain of the assets requisite
to production. These are nitrogen, helium gas, fuels, rubber, synthetic
liquid and abaca (a plant the fiber of which is used in making hemp).<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
Thus the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority were
given power to exercise the right of eminent domain<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> and to make
and sell fixed nitrogen and fertilizers with the specific injunction that
it maintain in stand-by condition suitable facilities for the production
of explosives in the event of war or a national emergency.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> The plant
might be used for the fixation of nitrogen for agricultural purposes
or leased, as long as conversion to war production could be made
quickly. The TVA of course was authorized to produce and sell
electric power,<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> but the government reserved the right in case of war
or national emergency declared by Congress to preempt TVA-produced
electricity as well as nitrogen.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> The Helium Gas Conservation
Act of 1937 authorized the Secretary of the Interior, through
the Bureau of Mines, to acquire lands, and acquire or construct such
plants as were necessary to establish a federal monopoly of helium.</p>

<p>In 1942 the Secretary of Agriculture was authorized to construct
or operate factories for the growth and processing of guayule and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
other rubber-bearing plants.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> In 1947 Congress proclaimed the
continued existence of a short supply of rubber, a highly strategic
and critical material needed for the common defense and which
cannot, in its natural state, be grown in the United States. It reaffirmed
the policy that there shall be maintained at all times in the
interest of the national security and common defense, in addition
to stock piles of natural rubber, a technologically advanced and
rapidly expandable domestic rubber-producing industry. To this end,
the powers of the United States to manufacture and sell synthetic
rubber were to continue in force and the government would retain
at least the minimum copolymer plant capacity to produce “not less
than six hundred thousand long tons per year.”<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> A year later, in
March 1948, a policy of reliance upon the development of a free,
competitive synthetic-rubber industry and the termination of government
production was enunciated, the President to exercise certain
powers of control to insure the existence of an extensive government
demand for domestic synthetic-rubber.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

<p>The synthetic liquid fuels program was established in 1944. The
Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Mines, was
authorized to develop and maintain one or more demonstration
plants to produce synthetic liquid fuels from coal, oil shale, and
other substances, and one or more demonstration plants to produce
liquid fuels from agricultural and forestry products. The Bureau
of Mines would also develop all facilities and accessories for the manufacture,
purification, storage, and distribution of the products.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
Unlike the other plans for production of essential defense elements
or commodities, this program was not designed directly to meet a
major portion of defense needs for the commodity produced. Rather,
the plants were to be of the minimum size which would allow the
government to furnish industry with the necessary cost and engineering
data for the development of a synthetic liquid-fuel industry.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>In the Abaca Production Act of 1950, Congress declared that abaca,
a hard fiber used in the making of marine and other cordage, is a highly
strategic and critical material which cannot be produced in commercial
quantities in the continental United States, and of which an adequate
supply is vital to the industrial and military requirements for the
common defense of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> The federal government was
therefore to continue the program for the production and sale of abaca
in which it was engaged at the termination of hostilities and to encourage
abaca production throughout the world. The total acreage
produced by the government was not to exceed fifty thousand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
fluctuating below that upper limit at the discretion of the President.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>The year of Dunkirk witnessed a number of Congressional authorizations
to the Executive to acquire and either directly utilize, or pass
on to private enterprise, material of war, or productive equipment
and facilities. In mid-1940 the President was given power to authorize
the Secretary of War to manufacture in factories and arsenals under
his jurisdiction, or otherwise procure, coast-defense and anti-aircraft
material, including ammunition therefor, on behalf of any American
Republic. He might also establish repair facilities for such equipment.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
This was shortly extended to manufacturing for the government
of any country whose defense the President deemed vital to the
defense of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> Later in 1940 he was authorized to
requisition and take over for use of the United States any military
or naval equipment or munitions which had been ordered for export,
but which then could no longer be exported. Certain items of a military
nature could not, for example, be sent to France once the Germans
had occupied that country. The President could dispose of such
material to a private corporation or individual if such action was
deemed to be in the public interest.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> The June 30, 1942 termination
date was moved forward to June 30, 1944, and the President’s power
enlarged to requisition in the interest of national defense or prosecution
of war in July 1942.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>In June 1940 the Secretary of the Navy was authorized to provide
necessary construction facilities or manufacturing plants on federal
land or elsewhere, and to man them with federal employees or otherwise
whenever he found it impossible to make contracts or to secure
facilities for procurement or construction of items authorized in connection
with national defense.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> By October 1941 this authority had
grown to a general authorization to the President, that if he found
that the use of any military or naval equipment, supplies, or munitions,
or machinery, tools, or materials necessary for the manufacture, servicing
and operation of such equipment, were needed for the defense of
the United States the President could requisition such property.
Only two conditions prevailed: first, that the need was immediate and
impending, and second, that just compensation was paid to the
owners. The original expiration date of June 30, 1943 was later
changed to June 30, 1944.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> But long before the Second World War,
Congress gave the President authority to requisition merchant
vessels. In Section 902 (a) of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 the
government reserved the right to requisition any vessel documented
under the laws of the United States, during any national emergency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
declared by proclamation of the President.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> In authorizing the
President to utilize the power of eminent domain to acquire land
needed for pipe-line construction by private firms, Congress provided
that in the event it was impracticable for any private person promptly
and satisfactorily to construct such lines, the President could provide
for the construction by such department as he might designate.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>
The government thus was privileged to go into the pipe-line business,
constructing and operating defense needed pipe-lines. Among the
prerogatives which Congress made available to the Secretary of the
Navy for purposes of insuring adequacy of maritime salvage operations
during the war, was that of acquiring such vessels and equipment as
he might deem necessary therefor.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> The Secretary also was empowered
to transfer, by charter or otherwise, such equipment for
operation by private salvage companies.</p>

<p>The Defense Production Act of 1950 gave the President powers virtually
equal to those granted by Congress to the President in
1941. Again the President was empowered to requisition needed
materials for the defense of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> And in July 1953
the three armed service secretaries were empowered to acquire, construct,
establish, expand, rehabilitate or convert industrial plants,
either publicly or privately owned, as might be needed for the defense
of the United States. The statutory language followed the familiar
prescription that acquisition could be by purchase, donation, lease,
condemnation or otherwise as necessary.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Facilitating Acquisition by Private Enterprises</span></h3>

<p>In July 1941 Congress used the power of eminent domain to facilitate
the construction of public utilities for defense purposes.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Upon
finding that the construction of any pipe-line for the transportation
and/or distribution of petroleum or petrol products moving in
interstate commerce was or might be necessary for national-defense
purposes, the President was permitted to acquire such land or interest
in land, including rights-of-way or easements, by the exercise of the
right of eminent domain, as, in his opinion might be necessary.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> The
President invoked this Act on a number of occasions.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<p>The Second War Powers Act earlier mentioned not only authorized
the acquisition of real property by the Secretaries of War and Navy
or their agents, but permitted them to dispose of such property or
interest therein by sale, lease or otherwise.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> The Small Business
Concerns Mobilization Act of June 1942 empowered the Smaller
War Plants Corporation, established under the Act,<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> to purchase or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
lease land, to purchase, lease, build, or expand plants, and to purchase
or produce equipment, facilities, machinery, materials, or supplies,
as might be needed to enable the Corporation to provide small business
concerns with the means and facilities to engage in the production of
war materials.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> The Corporation could also enter into contracts
with the United States government and any department, agency,
or officer of the government having procurement powers and obligate
the Corporation to furnish articles, equipment, supplies, or materials
to the government.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Availability of Federally Owned Property to Private Enterprise</span></h3>

<p>Actually no clean demarcation can be made between this and the
preceding section. A graduation can be established, moving from
statutes lending the power of eminent domain to private enterprise,
to those emphasizing government acquisition and lending or leasing,
and ultimately to those principally concerned with providing government-owned
equipment to private enterprise—the equipment presumably
already in the hands of the government or subject to acquisition
under other statues.</p>

<p>One of the very first Acts to provide for placing educational
production of munitions of war stipulated that initial orders placed
with any person, firm, or corporation for supplying such munitions,
accessories, or parts, could include a complete set of such gages, dies,
jigs, tools, fixtures, and other special aids and appliances, including
drawings as needed for the production of munitions in quantity
in the event of emergency.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> The title to all such facilities was to
remain in the government of the United States. The fiscal 1941
Navy Department Appropriations Act granted the Navy funds to
furnish Government-owned facilities at privately owned plants,<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> and
a July 1940 Act to expedite the strengthening of the national defense
accorded like authority to the President.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> Section 303 (a) (d) of
the Defense Production Act of 1950 gave the President a general
power to purchase raw materials including liquid fuels for government
use or for resale, and when in his judgment it would aid the national
defense, to install government-owned equipment in plants, factories,
and other industrial facilities owned by private persons.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Acquisitions Incidental to Enforcement of a Control Program</span></h3>

<p>Of the acquisition statutes hitherto discussed, most required that
an effort be made to negotiate a fair price with the individual or
concern whose property was acquired and, failing that, recourse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
might be had to eminent domain proceedings. By the terms of the
latter, private entrepreneurs or investors in effect are confronted with
the option of utilizing their property in conformity with the Government’s
mobilization program or, in lieu thereof, of relinquishing it
to the Government. The statutes now to be considered sanction
acquisition of private property in those cases in which the owners or
operators are not managing it to the Government’s satisfaction.</p>

<p>A June 1940 Act to expedite national defense empowered the
Secretary of the Navy, under the general direction of the President,
whenever he deemed any existing manufacturing plant or facility
necessary for the national defense, and whenever he was unable to
arrive at an agreement with the owner of any such plant or facility
for its use or operation, to take over and operate such plant or facility
either by Government personnel or by contract with private firms.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
The Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 authorized the President,
acting through the Secretaries of War or Navy, to take immediate
possession of any plant or plants which in the opinion of the
Secretary of War or the Secretary of the Navy were capable of
being readily geared to war production. This drastic action came
only when the owners refused to give to the United States preference
in the matter of the execution of orders, or refused to manufacture
the kind, quantity, or quality of arms or ammunition, or who refused
to furnish the materials demanded at a reasonable price.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>The War Labor Disputes Act gave the President a similar power
to seize struck industries. It might be exercised with respect to
any plant, mine, or facility equipped for the manufacture, production,
or mining of any articles or materials which might be required for the
war effort, or which might be useful in connection therewith. But a
presidential finding was necessary first, that there was an interruption
of the operation of the plant, mine, or facility as a result of a strike
or other labor disturbance, and that the war effort would be unduly
impeded or delayed by the interruption, and that the exercise of such
power and authority was necessary to insure operation in the interest
of the war effort.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p>Not, perhaps, punitive in its object, but nonetheless related to
enforcement of a control program, was the provision of the Emergency
Price Control Act of 1942, permitting the Price Administrator to buy
or sell commodities and goods or grant subsidies to assure necessary
production.<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">REGULATION OF PROPERTY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>We have seen that the effort to rationalize the national economy in
time of economic or war emergency may lead democratic governments
to assert a power to acquire the raw materials of production and productive
facilities. This power of acquisition may be designed or exercised
as a sanction for the coercion of “co-operation” upon the part of
the private units of the economy, or it may express the finding that
particular stockpiling or production functions can only, or most
efficiently be conducted by public agencies.</p>

<p>Significant as may be the readiness of democratic governments in
time of critical economic or crucial war emergency to enter
the market place or to produce, either to the exclusion of private
enterprises or in competition with them, these are exceptional circumstances;
rationalization of the economy is principally achieved by
coercing private owners and producers to act consistently with a
governmental definition of the public interest. It is such examples
of direct governmental control of private entrepreneurs, producers,
and distributors that are to be examined in this chapter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Control of Goods and Materials</span></h3>

<p>In surveying the possible alternatives of a nation aware of a threatened
or existing shortage of strategic raw materials or finished products
it is appropriate to review first negative and general controls
and thereafter to consider those which become increasingly particular
and positive. An initial precautionary move in such circumstances
is to prevent the escape of scarce materials from the country. Also
relevant thereto is the conservation of domestic supplies. Beyond
conservation, implementing these safeguards are affirmative programs
encouraging increased domestic production of such materials as well
as their importation from abroad. Such programs have been reviewed
under the heading of government acquisition. It will be recalled
that in addition to stockpiling strategic materials, the government
created and operated new productive facilities in an effort to insure
adequate supply. However, in addition to these measures the government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
generally has been unable to escape the necessity of establishing
priorities and allocations systems to insure that whatever supply is
available is utilized for successful prosecution of the war or to combat
effectively any other domestic emergency.</p>

<p><em>Restrictions on Export</em>: Congress, in the Tennessee Valley Authority
Act of 1933, stipulated that no products of the Corporation could
be sold for use outside of the United States, its Territories and possessions,
except to the United States government for the use of its Army
and Navy, or to its allies in case of war.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>In a series of enactments, commencing with a joint resolution of
May 1934, Congress sought to insulate the United States from the
danger of involvement in foreign wars by embargoing the shipment
of arms to foreign belligerents. The resolution mentioned enabled
the President after consultation with the governments of other
American Republics to proclaim that the prohibition of the sale of
arms and munitions of war in the United States to those countries
then engaged in armed conflict in the Chaco might contribute to the
reestablishment of peace between those countries, after which it would
become illegal to sell such material to the disputants or their agents.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>
On the same day that he signed the Chaco resolution, President
Roosevelt issued the proclamation contemplated by the Act.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> In
August 1935 the embargo method was imposed uniformly without
limitation as to area. The Neutrality Act of that year provided that
if war broke out between two or more foreign states, the President
should proclaim this fact, and thereafter it would be unlawful to
export arms, ammunition or implements of war from any place in
the United States, or its possessions to the belligerents, or to any
neutral area for eventual trans-shipment to a belligerent country.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
In addition, the Act placed a blanket prohibition upon the export or
import of arms, except insofar as authorized under license procured
from the National Munitions Control Board established by the Act.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
When he had cause to believe a given ship was about to carry material
to a belligerent, but the evidence was not deemed sufficient to justify
forbidding the departure, the President could require the owner or
commander to give a bond to the United States, with sufficient sureties,
that the vessel would not deliver the men, or the cargo, or any
part thereof to a belligerent.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>Congress maintained a vigilant oversight over enforcement of its
neutrality policy. Since the embargo authorized by the 1935 Act
could be applied only on the occurrence of war between, or among,
two or more foreign states, it could not be invoked in the Spanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Civil War. This situation Congress immediately rectified upon
assembling in January 1937. Public Resolution No. 1, which became
law on January 8, 1937, specifically prohibited the export of war
material for use of either of the opposing forces in Spain.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Thereafter
it amended the 1935 statute, retaining its provisions virtually intact,
but directing it at instances of internecine as well as international
war.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> The same day that the President signed this law, he issued
a proclamation finding that a state of civil strife unhappily existed in
Spain and prohibited the direct or indirect export of material of war
to either of the opposing armies.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>A series of proclamations were issued under this and other contingent
emergency statutes in September 1939.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> The prohibition on
export of war material was narrowed to a prohibition on the export
of such material until title had unconditionally passed to the foreign
purchaser—the cash and carry system.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> A number of Presidential
proclamations effected application of the new statute.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>Presidential proclamations also reflect the change in emphasis of
statutory prohibitions of the export of war materials. In September
1939, the President issued a clearly neutrality-oriented proclamation
prohibiting enlistment in, or recruitment for, belligerent armed forces,
provisioning of belligerent ships,<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> and subsequent proclamations of
1940 and 1941 were equally clearly concerned with preserving adequate
domestic stocks of strategic materials.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>Upon amendment of the July 1940<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Act in June 1942, the President
was authorized to prohibit or curtail the exportation of any articles,
technical data, materials, or supplies, except under such rules and
regulations as he might prescribe.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Unless the President otherwise
directed, the functions and duties of the President under this section
of the Act were to be performed by the Board of Economic Warfare.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
The Export Control Act of 1949 empowered the President to prohibit
or curtail the exportation from the United States, its Territories and
possessions, of any articles, materials, or supplies, including technical
data but excluding agricultural commodities in excess of domestic
requirements.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> The purpose here was to protect the United States
from the excessive drain of scarce materials.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> The Atomic Energy
Act also prohibited the export from or import into the United States
or curtail the exportation from the United States, its Territories and
as authorized by the Atomic Energy Commission upon a determination
by the President that the common defense and security would
not be adversely affected thereby.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span></p>

<p>Obviously embraced within the power to embargo is the power
conditionally to permit exports. Thus, in December 1941 following
Pearl Harbor, Congress permitted the President, whenever he deemed
it to be in the interest of national defense, to authorize the Secretary
of War to sell, transfer title to, exchange, lease, lend, or otherwise
dispose of, to the government of any country whose defense the President
deemed vital to the defense of the United States, any defense
article procured from funds appropriated for the military establishment
prior to or since March 11, 1941.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>In formulating an export policy for the period following World War
II era, Congress doubtless has been influenced by the post war inflation.
The Export Control Act of 1949, in granting the President
power to prohibit or curtail the exportation of certain materials, including
technical data,<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> made explicit the Congressional intent to
protect the domestic economy from the excessive drain of scarce
materials and to reduce the inflationary impact of abnormal foreign
demand.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<p><em>Domestic Conservation</em>: With a view to stabilizing prices and
encouraging the conservation of deposits of crude oil situated within
the United States Congress in 1935 prohibited the interstate shipment
of contraband oil (i.e., oil produced in excess of state imposed
quotas).<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Two different provisions of the Second War Powers Act
of 1942 related to conservation of strategic materials. Section 801
empowered the President to direct the Administrator of the Federal
Security Agency to assign the manpower of the Civilian Conservation
Corps to the extent necessary to protect the munitions, aircraft, and
other war industries, municipal water supply, power and other
utilities, and to protect resources subject to the hazards of forest
fires.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Section 1201 permitted the Director of the Mint to vary the
metallic composition of five cent pieces to conserve strategic metals.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p><em>Priorities and Allocation</em>: In late May 1941, Congress provided
that whenever the President was satisfied that the fulfillment of requirements
for the defense of the United States would result in a
shortage in the supply of any material for defense or for private
account or for export, the President could allocate the material in
whatever manner he deemed necessary or appropriate in the public
interest and to promote the national defense.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> This provision was
retained in the Second War Powers Act of 1942.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> In a joint resolution
of March 1947 declaring the need for maintenance of a technologically
advanced and rapidly expandable domestic rubber-producing industry
and for a Congressional study of the problem, Congress provided that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
in the interim, pending the enactment of permanent legislation, the
government should continue allocation, specification, and inventory
controls of natural and synthetic rubber.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> A year later this power
was continued. The President was authorized to exercise allocation,
specification, and inventory controls of natural rubber and synthetic
rubber to insure the consumption of general-purpose synthetic rubber
as a part of the estimated total annual consumption of natural rubber.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>The First Decontrol Act of 1947, providing for the termination of
certain of the provisions of the Second War Powers Act, permitted
the continued exercise of power to allocate materials which were certified
by the Secretaries of State and Commerce as necessary to meet
international commitments.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Section 101 of the Defense Production
Act of 1950 empowered the President to allocate materials in such
manner, upon such conditions, and to such extent as he deems necessary
or appropriate to promote the national defense.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> A related
section provided that no person should accumulate (1) in excess of the
reasonable demands of business, personal, or home consumption, or
(2) for the purpose of resale at prices in excess of prevailing market
prices, materials which had been designated by the President as
scarce materials or materials the supply of which would be threatened
by such accumulation.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> The Atomic Energy Act of 1946, as amended
in 1951, expands the allocation power to its logical extreme by allocating
all fissionable material to the federal government, making it
unlawful for any person to possess or transfer any fissionable material,
except as authorized by the Atomic Energy Commission.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Control of Productive Facilities</span></h3>

<p><em>Priorities</em>: Particularly in the conversion period preceding full-scale
defense production it is necessary to compel producers to accord
first priority to fulfillment of government contracts. During such
interval prior to all-out defense mobilization, when his competitors
may be satisfying the demands of consumers, the businessman has
ample cause to fear that in giving priority to government orders
disgruntled private customers will be permanently lost to competing
firms. Accordingly, a June 1940 statute provided that, in the discretion
of the President, fulfillment of Army or Navy contracts was to
take priority over all deliveries for private account or for export.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> In
a year this was amended to extend the President’s power over priorities
to include contracts or orders for the Government of any country
whose defense the President deemed vital to the defense of the United
States and contracts or orders, or subcontracts or sub-orders, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
the President deemed necessary or appropriate to promote the defense
of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> In May 1941 the Maritime Commission was
empowered to demand that work on its contracts take priority over
the furnishing of materials or performance of work for private account
or for export.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> The Second War Powers Act continued in effect the
provision of the June 1940 and May 1941 statutes<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> by providing that
all orders for vessels, equipment, and weapons placed by the Army
and Navy were, in the discretion of the President, to take priority
over all deliveries for private account or for export.</p>

<p>To repair the Spring 1945 flood damages, Congress in June of that
year granted the War Production Board, and every other governmental
agency which had jurisdiction over allocations and priorities
relating to farm machinery and equipment, authorization to take
such steps as might be necessary to provide for the necessary allocations
and priorities to enable farmers in the areas affected by floods
in 1944 and 1945 to replace and repair their farm machinery and equipment
which was destroyed or damaged by floods, or windstorms, or
fire caused by lightning, and to continue farming operations.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>Again, the Defense Production Act of 1950 gave the President
virtually plenary power to require that defense orders be given priority
by private industry: “The President is hereby authorized ... to require
that performance under contracts or orders (other than contracts of
employment) which he deems necessary or appropriate to promote
the national defense shall take priority over performance under any
other contract or order.”<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Perhaps not classifiable as examples of an
assertion of governmental priority in the use of productive facilities
are three enactments under which the Federal Government has exercised
the right to withhold issuance of patents and to reserve certain
inventions for its exclusive use whenever the public safety or defense
so require.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p><em>Compulsory Orders</em>: The establishment of priorities for the fulfillment
of contracts presupposes voluntary fulfillment of government
contracts by private industry. Do the principles of democratic
government preclude conscription of industrial plants, regardless of
the willingness or unwillingness of owners to execute war contracts?
Having conscripted physically eligible young men under the Selective
Training and Service Act of 1940 Congress also established therein
priority for industrial performance on military orders, and a provision
to compel acceptance and priority performance on defense orders.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
The President was empowered, through the head of the War Department
or the Navy Department, to place orders with any individual,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
firm, association, company, corporation, or organized manufacturing
industry for whatever materials might be required, and which were
of the nature and kind usually produced or at least capable of being
produced by the productive units involved. General Motors produced
automobiles, but they could also produce tanks or trucks as the Army
required. Compliance with all such orders for products or materials
was obligatory and took precedence over all other orders and contracts
previously placed.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> The use of plant seizure by the government as
the sanction for infraction of the provision has previously been reviewed
in the section on acquisition. In the Second War Powers
Act of 1942 the President was given the plenary power to require
acceptance of and performance under defense contracts or orders in
preference to all other contracts or orders.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> More recently, the Defense
Production Act of 1950 and the 1953 amendment to it authorize
the President to require acceptance and performance of such contracts
or orders as he deems necessary or appropriate to promote the
national defense.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p><em>Protection of Quality</em>: Only one example in this category has been
discovered. In 1940 Congress amended an old World War I law,
vintage 1918, that provided punishment for the willful injury or
destruction of war materials or war premises used in connection with
war material.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> Sections 5 and 6 of this Act imposed maximum penalties
of $10,000 fine and ten years imprisonment for willfully injuring
or destroying national defense materials, whatever they might be,
premises or utilities, or willfully making defective defense material
or equipment utilized for the production of defense material. An
important element of the offense was existence of an intent to injure,
interfere with, or obstruct the national defense of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
While laws against sabotage have been enforced vigorously, this 1918
law was designed to protect the Government against shoddy workmanship
and poor equipment.</p>

<p><em>Controlling Labor Relations</em>: Emergency provisions regulating
labor relations in private enterprise appear to have four different motivations.
First, wide scale control of the relations between employers
and employees may constitute an integral part of a total program
aimed at countering an economic depression. Second, it may be aimed
at preventing unethical practices. Third, the purpose may be to avoid
interruption of vital production. And, fourth, the control may be
designed as a precaution against espionage, sabotage, or other violation
of the national security.</p>

<p>The National Industrial Recovery Act obviously conceived as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
emergency legislation which it indubitably was, is the outstanding
example of an endeavor in part through the regulation of employer-employee
relations, to overcome an economic depression.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> The objective
of course was to increase consumer income and purchasing
power, which in turn was to stimulate production, with related chain
effects. Section 7 (a) required that every code of fair competition
established under the Act guaranteed employees the right to bargain
collectively, and to join or refrain from joining a union. Company
unions were outlawed. Employers were to comply with the maximum
hours or labor, minimum rates of pay, and other conditions of employment,
approved or prescribed by the President. In Section 4 (b) the
President was granted the unprecedented power whenever he found
“that destructive wage or price cutting or other activities contrary
to the policy of this title were being practiced in any trade or industry
or any subdivision thereof,” to license business enterprises in order to
make effective a code of fair competition or an agreement that would
carry out the policy of the Act. Once a finding had been made, and
publicly announced, no one could carry on any business, if in interstate
commerce, unless a license had been obtained. Any order of the
President suspending or revoking any such license was to be final if in
accordance with law.</p>

<p>Title II of the Act, pertaining to public works projects, closely
regulated employment practices on projects contracted under the
Act: Convict labor was prohibited; no one, except in an administrative
or executive position could work more than thirty hours a week;
all employees were to be paid just and reasonable wages sufficient to
provide a standard of living in decency and comfort; wherever possible
ex-servicemen with dependents were to be given preference in employment;
and human labor in preference to machinery was to be used
wherever practicable and consistent with sound economy and public
advantage.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> In June 1934 Congress authorized the establishment
of labor boards to enforce the labor relations provisions of the
N.I.R.A.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> As is well known these sweeping provisions were later
swept aside in the famed case of <cite>Schechter Poultry Corporation</cite> v.
<cite>United States</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> wherein Mr. Justice Cardozo, speaking for a unanimous
Court, said “this is delegation run rampant.”</p>

<p>Next to be considered are controls designed to forestall interruption
of vital production. Section 8 of the War Labor Disputes Act required
30 days notice of a prospective strike and secret balloting of the
union members concerned.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Other sections of the Act authorized
government seizure of struck plants, and made it unlawful to interfere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
with government operation of plants.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> The Labor Management
Relations Act of 1947 set forth procedure whereby the President may
secure injunctions postponing strikes or lockouts which will, if permitted
to occur or to continue, imperil the national health or safety.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<p><em>Controlling Profits</em>: The campaign of the 1930’s to take the profits
out of war is well known. Correlative to the deeply felt aspiration in
time of peace to end the resort to war as an instrument of policy,
is the popular thesis that war and the profitability of war production
have a causal connection. In time of war, the public, on the other
hand, is receptive to the proposal that command of the services and
lives of mature young human beings warrants conscription of capital
at least to the extent necessary to avoid profiteering, or to the
extent such conscription facilitates the attainment of other worthy
defense goals. In harmony with these beliefs the Vinson-Trammell
Act of 1934 authorizing naval construction within the limits of the
Washington and London treaties of 1922 and 1930 instructed the
Secretary of the Navy to make no contract for the construction and/or
manufacture of any complete naval vessel or aircraft, or any
portion thereof unless the contractor agreed to certain conditions:
(1) he had to agree to pay any profit in excess of ten percent of the
total contract price to the United States Treasury (twelve percent
was allowed as the profit margin on aircraft); and (2) he could
make no subdivisions of any contract or subcontract for the same
article or articles for the purpose of evading the provisions of the
Act.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<p>In 1938 provisions for close supervision of the leasing of naval
petroleum reserves also were imposed upon the Navy Department,
obviously directed in part at precluding extortionate profit-making
from such leases.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a></p>

<p>In permitting emergency negotiation of contracts for the acquisition
of construction of war vessels or material with or without
competitive bidding, upon determination that the price was fair
and reasonable the Act of June 28, 1940 to expedite national defense
afforded the Secretaries of War and Treasury authority to modify
existing contracts, including Coast Guard contracts, as the Secretary
concerned believed necessary.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Presumably upon a later finding that
an agreed price was not fair and reasonable, profits could be revised
downward through resort to Section 9 permitting contract modification
at the discretion of the Secretary. Again, the Second War Powers
Act of 1942, in permitting the Secretary of the Navy, when authorized
by the President, to negotiate contracts for the acquisition, construction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
repair, or alteration of complete naval vessels or aircraft,
or any portion thereof,<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> stipulated that the cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost
system of contracting should not be used unless considered
necessary by the Secretary of the Navy, in which case the percentage
was not to exceed seven percent.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> By way of enforcement the
government reserved the right to inspect the plants and audit the
books of contractors.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>Authority to award contracts without competitive bidding was
not freely granted. A Supplemental Defense Appropriations Act of
1942 required the Secretaries of War and Navy to report to the
Congress all defense contracts in excess of $150,000 and to justify
those awarded without competitive bidding.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> The Secretaries were
authorized and directed to insert in any contract for an amount in
excess of $100,000 a provision for the renegotiation of the contract
price.<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> In 1951, declaring that sound execution of the national defense
program requires the elimination of excessive profits from contracts
made with the United States, and from related subcontracts, in the
course of such program, Congress enacted the Renegotiation Act
of 1951 providing for the renegotiation of defense contracts netting
contractors more than a reasonable profit.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Control of Credit, Exchange, Prices</span></h3>

<p><em>Credit</em>: The major purpose of the Defense Production Act of 1950
was to place the national economy on a war production footing with
minimal possible effect upon civilian production and consumption.
An effort was made to expand the total productive facilities of the
nation beyond the levels needed to meet the civilian demand, thus
reducing the need to curtail civilian consumption. To some extent,
however, it was anticipated that normal civilian production and
purchases would have to be curtailed and redirected.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> In this connection
the Federal Reserve Board by law was empowered to impose
consumer credit controls pursuant to an Executive Order<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> until
such time as the President determined that the exercise of such
controls were no longer necessary. The controls, of course, were
to be directed at carrying out the objectives of the Defense Production
Act.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> In addition, the President was authorized from time to time
to prescribe regulations for regulating real estate construction credit
as he believed necessary to prevent or reduce excessive fluctuations
in such credit. He was empowered to prescribe maximum loan or
credit values, minimum down payments, trade-in or exchange values,
maximum maturities and maximum amounts of credit.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> These, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
course, were direct controls, as distinguished from inducements or
incentives designed to reduce civilian demand for materials and
productive facilities needed by the military establishment.</p>

<p>Opposite to the use of credit controls as a means of reducing
effective consumer demand is direct intervention to insure that
adequate credit is available to finance business activities declared
by the Government to be essential to national defense. Conceivably
the government could require that lending institutions, under certain
conditions, make such grants. In lieu thereof it sought to provide
incentives to lending institutions to make loans to defense producers,
and avoided compelling extension of such credit. In fact, credit
was made available through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation,
the Smaller War Industries Administration and most recently the
Small Business Administration. As a <i lang="la">quid pro quo</i> the government
compels the recipient of such aid to submit to supervision.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> Equally
effective as loans in financing needed defense construction or production
are advances to contractors. In providing for the construction
of pipe-lines for the transportation of petroleum products, Congress
in 1941 permitted the President to make such advances as he deemed
advisable, through such departments as he might designate to the
contractors.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> It also authorized the Secretary of Navy to advance
to private salvage companies such funds as the Secretary thought
necessary to provide for the immediate financing of salvage operations.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p><em>Exchange</em>: The May 1937 amendment to the Neutrality Act made
it unlawful, when the President had issued a proclamation that a
state of war between two or more states or a state of civil war in a
foreign state existed for any person in the United States to purchase,
sell, or exchange bonds, securities or other obligations of the governments
of any belligerent states or to loan, or to collect contributions.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>
The First War Powers Act of 1941 echoed this provision, providing
in Title III, Trading with the Enemy, that the President in time of
national emergency declared by him might investigate, regulate, or
prohibit any transactions in foreign exchange, transfers of credit
or payments.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> The Export Control Act of 1949 permitted the President
to stipulate the rules which should apply to the financing,
transporting, and other servicing of exports.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p><em>Price Control</em>: In time of war the capitalist economy is transformed
into a closely administered economy regulated in an effort to maximize
war production and minimize dislocation of the civilian economy.
To prevent speculation and dissipation of tax and consumer dollars
through continuous and unchecked price increases, it becomes necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
that prices be subjected to government control. This was
the aim of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942. Whenever
in the judgment of the Price Administrator the price or prices of
a commodity or commodities threatened to rise to an extent inconsistent
with the purposes of the Act, the Price Administrator could
establish whatever maximum price or prices he thought equitable
and fair. The only guide lines for “fair and equitable” in establishing
a maximum price were the prices prevailing between October 1 and
October 15, 1941.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> He was further empowered to recommend stabilization
or reduction of rents in defense-rental areas. Where state
or local boards failed to heed the recommendation the Administrator
could by regulation or order establish maximum rents for such
accomodations as in his judgment would be generally fair and equitable
and would effectuate the purposes of the Act. Rent levels
were established on the basis of those prevailing on April 1, 1941.
The Act was amended in October 1942 when Congress authorized
and directed the President on or before November 1, 1942, to issue a
general order stabilizing prices, wages, and salaries affecting the cost
of living. Stabilization was so far as practicable, to be on the basis
of the levels which existed on September 15, 1942.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> The President
was also given power by regulation to limit or prohibit the payment
of double time except when, because of emergency conditions, an
employee is required to work for seven consecutive days in any
regularly scheduled work week.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>In an effort to adapt the price control program to postwar reconversion
and prepare for its eventual termination Congress in
July 1946 extended the life of the Price Control Act of 1942 to
June 30, 1947, admonishing the Office of Price Administration and
other agencies to use their price powers to promote the earliest
practicable balance between production and demand: Congress
wanted the control of prices and the use of subsidy powers to be
terminated as rapidly as possible.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> The President was directed to
recommend to the Congress legislation needed to establish monetary,
fiscal, and other policies adequate to supplement the control of
prices and wages during the balance of the fiscal year 1947. A Joint
Resolution of March 1947 continued the price control program with
regard to sugar until October 31, 1947.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> Rent control as well as
other war production controls continued in effect by the Defense
Production Act of 1950 which authorized the President to establish
a ceiling or ceilings on the price, rental, commission, rate, fee, charge
or allowance paid or received on the sale or delivery, or the purchase or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
receipt, by or to any person, of any material or service. And the
same Act required that the President issue regulations and orders
stabilizing wages, salaries, and other compensation.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> Once the
Korean War ended, all controls, price, rent and credit were swept
off the statute books.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Control of Common Carriers</span></h3>

<p>Congressional enactments under this head generally fall into three
major categories: control of domestic transportation, control of
carriage by American ships, and control of foreign vessels in American
ports. Our interest is confined exclusively to emergency controls
exercisable by the Interstate Commerce Commission and similar
federal regulatory agencies.</p>

<p><em>Control of Domestic Common Carriers</em>: The Emergency Railroad
Transportation Act of 1933 was designed to facilitate rehabilitation
of the depression ridden American railroads. An Act addressed to
economic rather than military emergency, it had nonetheless military
overtones. The maintenance of an efficiently functioning railroad
system capable of meeting potential American defense needs was an
objective that could not be overlooked in the formulation of a successful
railroad policy. The Act set up a Coordinator of Transportation
who was to divide the railroad lines into three groups: eastern,
southern, and western.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> A number of railroad coordinating committees
were created to carry out the purposes of the Act—i.e.,
elimination of unnecessary duplication of services and facilities,
control of allowances, etc., and avoidance of undue impairment of
net earnings, and other wastes and preventable expense, and promotion
of financial reorganization.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> Whenever unable to carry
out these reforms the committees were to recommend action to the
Coordinator who might, at his discretion, issue an order embodying
their recommendations. When the committees failed to act on
matters brought to their attention by the Coordinator he was
authorized and directed to issue and enforce such order, giving
appropriate directions to the carriers and subsidiaries subject to
the Interstate Commerce Act as he found to be consistent with the
public interest.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>Like the N.I.R.A. the Act contained a provision dealing with labor
relations. The Railroads were prohibited from reducing the number
of their employees below the number as shown by the pay rolls of
employees in service during the month of May, 1933, after deducting
the number who had been removed from the payrolls after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
effective date of the Act by reason of death, normal retirement, or
resignation.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> A regional committee system was established for the
representation of employees, and provision made for regional boards
of adjustment to settle controversies between carriers and employees.
Carriers and employees were to be equally represented on such
boards.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> The Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended in 1934,
attempted to establish a pattern of free union-management negotiation
of disputes with ultimate recourse to a National Mediation
Board.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>Air transportation received the attention of Congress in a June
1934 statute establishing a commission to make a report to the
Congress recommending an aviation policy.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> The Commission was
to report its recommendations of a broad policy covering all phases
of aviation and the relation of the United States thereto. Subsequently
the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 was enacted, embodying
congressional policy in this field.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> In 1950 a security provision was
added to the Act, permitting the Secretary of Commerce whenever
he determined such action to be required in the interest of national
security to establish airspace zones in which civilian flights could
be restricted or prohibited.<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>Another original statute in this field was the Communications
Act of 1934, whereunder interstate and foreign commerce in communication
by wire and radio is regulated. Federal controls were
aimed at insuring existence of a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and
world-wide wire and radio communication service for the convenience
of the public and for the purpose of national defense.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>
Created thereunder was the Federal Communications Commission
to which elaborate regulatory powers were granted. During the
continuance of a war in which the United States was engaged, the
Act authorized the President to direct that such communications
as in his judgment were deemed to be essential to the national
defense and security should have preference or priority with any
carrier subject to the Act. He could give these directions at and
for such times as he determined and he could modify, change, suspend
or annul them.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> The President also was authorized to prevent any
obstructions by physical force or intimidations by threats of physical
force of interstate and foreign radio or wire communications.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>The pipe-line construction provision of July 30, 1941 required that
pipe lines constructed with government aid be constructed subject
to whatever terms and conditions the President prescribed as necessary
for national defense purposes.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> The second War Powers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
Act of 1942 gave the Interstate Commerce Commission wartime
authority with respect to motor carriers, to be exercised under
circumstances and procedure equivalent to the authority it had
with respect to other carriers. It could issue reasonable directives
with respect to equipment, service and facilities of motor carriers
and require the joint use of equipment, terminals, warehouses, garages,
and other facilities. Motor carriers were to be subject to the same
penalties for failure to comply with action taken by the Commission
as any other carriers under its jurisdiction.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> In June 1953 Congress
continued in effect traffic priority powers of the I.C.C. which had
been granted during the war and continued by the Emergency
Powers Continuation Act.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p><em>Control of Carriage by American Vessels</em>: The Neutrality Act of
1935 had provided that, following a presidential finding of the
existence of war between two foreign states, it would be unlawful
for any American vessel to carry any arms to any port of the belligerent
or to any neutral port for trans-shipment to, or for the use
of, belligerents.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> Penalty for violation of this prohibition might
include $10,000 fine, five years imprisonment, and, in addition, the
vessel, her tackle, apparel, furniture, equipment and armaments
would be forfeited to the United States.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> In addition vessels were
prohibited from carrying war material to belligerent warships which
presumably would effect transfer at sea. If the President or his
delegate had adequate reason to believe a ship about to carry war
material to a belligerent warship, he could prohibit departure; or
if the evidence did not warrant this, the owner or commander
could be required to give a bond to the United States, with sufficient
sureties, in whatever amount the President deemed proper, conditioned
so that the vessel would not deliver the men or the cargo, or
any part thereof, to any warship. Evasion of this prohibition subjected
a vessel to the possibility of being confined to port for the
duration of the war.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> Application of this Act to Spain was effected
by a Joint Resolution of January 8, 1937.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<p>The prohibition of American carriage of war material to belligerents
in international or civil war was rephrased in the 1937
amendments to the Act but kept essentially intact. Section 10
of the 1937 Act explicitly prohibited the arming of American vessels
engaged in commerce with any belligerent state, or any state wherein
civil strife exists.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> President Roosevelt immediately issued a Proclamation
finding the existence of civil war in Spain, promulgating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
a list of articles to be considered material of war, and prohibiting their
carriage to Spain by American vessels.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p>

<p>The Neutrality Act was made more stringent in November 1939.
While it was unlawful to export or transport war materials from
the United States to a belligerent until all right, title, and interest
therein had been transferred to some foreign government,<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> it was
unlawful for American vessels to carry <em>any</em> passengers or <em>any</em> articles
or materials to <em>any</em> belligerent.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> Furthermore, the President was
empowered to define combat areas, from which American vessels were
by law excluded. The prohibition against arming American merchant
vessels was continued. In August 1940, following the fall of France,
and while the British prepared for a German channel invasion,
the Act was liberalized to permit American vessels in ballast,
unarmed and not under convoy to transport refugee children, under
sixteen years of age, from war zones, or combat areas if the vessel
were proceeding under safe conduct granted by all of the States
named in the proclamations.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p>

<p>In 1953 Congress placed on the statute books a provision suggestive
of the old neutrality acts. Under this law the Secretary of the
Treasury, or anyone designated by the President, could seize and
detain any carrier-vessel, vehicle or aircraft carrying munitions
of war from the United States. The authority to “seize and detain”
came into operation whenever an attempt was made to export, ship
or take out of the United States any munitions of war or other
materials in violation of law. Moreover, the law became operative
as long as there was “probable cause to believe” that prohibited
items were being removed from the United States in violation of
the law.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>The Merchant Marine Act of 1936 is, of course, another of those
organic statutes designed to promote, rehabilitate, and regulate in
the interest of the trade and of the public, a segment of the American
transportation system. We have already seen that in this Act the
government secured the right in time of war emergency to requisition
American registered vessels. As a condition of the grant of
subsidies toward the construction of vessels in American yards,
the Maritime Commission reserved a power of final approval of
the design of such vessels. This power was of course shared with
the Navy Department which had to approve all defense features
in the proposed vessel.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> Under the terms of the Act any vessels,
the construction of which was subsidized, were to be so designed
as to be readily and quickly convertible into transport and supply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
vessels in a time of national emergency.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> By permitting it to
subsidize operation on approved routes, Title VI of the Act in effect
enabled the Commission to control also the allocation of American
shipping on the various world trade routes.</p>

<p>In July 1941 the President was given power, during the emergency
which he had declared on May 27 of that year, to authorize the
Maritime Commission to issue warrants entitling vessels to priority
over merchant vessels not holding such warrants, in the use of
facilities for loading, discharging, lighterage or storage of cargoes,
the procurement of fuel, towing, overhauling, drydocking or repair
of such vessels. Vessels holding warrants had priority among themselves
in accordance with the rules of the Maritime Commission.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
In granting warrants, the Commission was to make fair and reasonable
provision for priorities. The criteria for helping the Commission
determine priorities were: (1) the importation of substantial quantities
of strategic and critical materials, (2) the transportation of
substantial quantities of materials when such transportation was
requested by any defense agency, and (3) the transportation in
the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States of substantial
quantities of materials deemed by the Commission to be essential
to the defense of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>Certain controls were imposed on the staffing of American vessels.
A statute of December 17, 1941 made it unlawful to employ any
person or to permit any person to serve as radio operator abroad
any vessel (other than a vessel of foreign registry) if the Secretary
of the Navy disapproved the employment for any specified voyage,
route, or area of operation and had notified the master of the vessel
of the disapproval prior to the vessel’s departure.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> In 1934 a new
stipulation permitted the Commission to suspend the rule requiring
radio operators to have at least six months service before being
qualified as a radio operator. However, suspension of this qualification
could not be retained once the emergency had been terminated.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<p><em>Control of Foreign Vessels in American Waters</em>: The Neutrality
Act of 1935, as amended in May 1937, empowered the President
to place special restrictions on the use of the ports and territorial
waters of the United States. The restrictions which could be imposed
involved limiting access to American ports and territorial waters
by the submarines or merchant vessels of a foreign state. Special
restrictions could be imposed at the President’s discretion once he
determined that such restrictions were needed to protect the commercial
interests of the United States and its citizens, or to promote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
the security of the United States. Once limitations on port usage
had been imposed, it became unlawful for any foreign submarine
or armed merchant vessel to enter a port or territorial water of the
United States. Only the President could prescribe the conditions and
circumstances which would justify an exception to the rule.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>On October 18, 1939, President Roosevelt issued Proclamation
No. 2371 declaring it unlawful for belligerent submarines, whether
commercial or ships of war, to enter the ports or territorial waters of
the United States except when forced into such ports by <i lang="fr">force
majeure</i>.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> The Panama Canal Zone was exempted from this order.
Following enactment of the November 4, 1939 amendment to the
Neutrality Act,<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> a new proclamation with identical provisions was
promulgated in conformity with the revised law.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

</div>


<p>A contemporary “revisionist” school of historians devoted to a reappraisal
of accepted views of the cause and effect of American
participation in the Second World War, attributes significance to
the charge that the Roosevelt and Truman Administrations selected,
withheld, and released data to historians in a manner calculated to
distort the reasons for American involvement in that war.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Similar
charges of selective withholding or release of information, have, of
course, been levied against the Eisenhower Administration.</p>

<p>A daily reading of responsible newspapers quickly discloses abundant
examples of careful selectivity in the release of information by
government officials, can scarcely be denied. Indeed scholars,
journalists, and the American public are becoming increasingly
dependent upon the release of information by the federal government
for their interpretation of recent historical and current events.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
Whatever the import of this development, however, it is not within
the scope of this treatise. The present chapter is limited to a survey
and classification of statutory provisions relating to the withholding
and release of information by the government. It is accordingly
appropriate merely to acknowledge the possibility that intensive
research subsequently may disclose to what extent public opinion
has been prejudiced, distorted, or confused by the federal government’s
policies concerning the release of information.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Release of Information by the Government</span></h3>

<p>Statutes concerning the release of information by government
agencies appear to have been drafted with a view to accomplishing
the following purposes: (a) the convenience of other federal agencies;
(b) promotion of program administration or enforcement; (c) to
enable public opinion to influence and restrict administrative action.
Legislative provisions aimed at disseminating information for the
convenience of the public are included with (b) and (c).</p>

<p><em>The Convenience of Federal Agencies</em>: The Tennessee Valley Authority
Act of 1933 contains the only clearcut and noteworthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
example of the convenience type of provision thus far ascertained.
Section 19 of that Act affords the Tennessee Valley Corporation
access to the Patent Office as an instrumentality and agency of
the United States Government. The Corporation is authorized to
study, ascertain, and copy all methods, formulate any scientific
information necessary to enable it to employ the most efficient and
economical process for the production of fixed nitrogen.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p><em>Publicity as an Instrument of Program Administration</em>: As an
instrument of program administration, publicity may be utilized to influence
or coerce conformity with a program of control, or to facilitate
the servicing of agency clientele. The use of publicity as an
integral part of a control program is exemplified by routine publication
of that which is prohibited, as well as by disclosure designed to
exact compliance with government policy by subjecting those exposed
to unfavorable publicity. Section 102 of the Defense Production
Act of 1950, for example, prohibits the accumulation of scarce
materials in excess of personal or business needs or for purposes of
speculation. The President was directed to publish either in the
<cite>Federal Register</cite> or elsewhere, a list of materials the accumulation
of which would be unlawful.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Violators of this section of the law
would presumably suffer from publicity about unlawful hoarding, if
and when their activities became known to the federal government.
More explicit, but indicative of the same intent, was an Act of
July 1940 permitting the President to publish a list of persons designated
as collaborators with the Axis powers. Any person so
designated was prohibited from receiving military equipment or
munitions for export.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> In a proclamation of July 1941, President
Roosevelt authorized compilation and publication in the <cite>Federal
Register</cite> of “The Proclaimed List of Certain Blocked Nationals”
under the Act.<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>In statutory provisions for registration of categories of persons,
or maintenance of lists of various kinds, it is difficult, if not impossible,
to discern the various purposes to be served by such requirements.
Thus, if the major objective of the Foreign Agents Registration
Act of June 1938 was to secure for the government current information
concerning persons representing foreign governments or businesses,
and to impose a penalty for failure to register as a foreign agent,
certainly a minor purpose was to insure that members of the public
also should have this information available to them. Section 4 of
the Act required the Secretary of State to retain in permanent form
all statements filed under the Act, and to make them available for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
public examination and inspection at all reasonable hours.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> One
can hazard a guess as to what extent this publicity provision was
designed to intimidate so-called foreign agents.</p>

<p>For a precise illustration of an attempt to utilize public opinion
as a sanction, we need only look to the Labor-Management Relations
Act of 1947, which, in specifying the procedures to be followed in
settling national emergency strikes, obviously contemplated the
marshalling of public opinion, at a strategic point, through publication
of the second report of the President’s board of inquiry, describing
the current position of the parties and the efforts made for settlement.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>
The report is releasable after expiration of a sixty-day
suspension of the strike, as ordered by a Federal district court on
petition of the Attorney General.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>In the Armed Services Procurement Act of 1947, Congress announced
its intention that a fair proportion of the total purchases
and contracts for supplies and services for the government should be
placed with small business concerns, and provided with certain
exceptions for suitable advance publicity to achieve this end.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>In setting up the Small Business Administration in July 1953,
Congress directed it to provide technical and managerial aids to small-business
concerns, by advising and counselling on matters in connection
with government procurement and on policies, principles,
and practices of good management. Part of this responsibility would
be met by maintaining a clearing house for information concerning
the managing, financing, and operation of small business enterprises,
by disseminating such information, and by such other activities as
were deemed appropriate.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Designed to achieve a similar result is the
provision of the Federal Defense Act of 1950 enumerating among the
functions of the Federal Civil Defense Agency that of publicly
disseminating appropriate civil defense information.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>

<p>To protect private enterprise the Defense Housing and Community
Facilities and Services Act of 1951 requires that private enterprise
be afforded full opportunity to provide the defense housing needed
wherever possible and that, among other things, the number of
permanent dwelling units needed shall be publicly announced and
printed in the Federal Register.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> The Domestic Minerals Program
Extension Act of 1953 provides that the responsible agencies controlling
such strategic or critical minerals and metals purchase
programs publish the amounts of each of the ores and concentrates
purchased at the end of each calendar quarter under the program.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p><em>Publicity Designed to Enable Public Opinion to Influence and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
Restrict Administrative Action</em>: Characteristic provisions in this
category range from the requirement of publicity prior to taking action,
sometimes with the explicit provision for outside approval or disapproval
of proposed agency action, to the simple publication of action taken
by the agency, and sometimes to an explanation thereof. The Bank
Conservation Act of 1933 stated that before returning to private management
a bank for which he had appointed a “conservator” (receiver),
the Comptroller of the Currency publicize his intentions and obtain
permission of the depositors and stockholders.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>A steadily increasing number of statutory provisions require
an agency to report in advance to Congress, the substance of contemplated
agency action, which action cannot be implemented unless
approved by the Congress.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> One example will suffice as an illustration.
The Alien Registration Act of 1940 entrusted the Attorney
General with a limited power to suspend deportation of certain
aliens upon his finding that such deportation would result in serious
economic detriment to a citizen or legally resident alien who is the
spouse, parent, or minor child of the deportable alien.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> Whenever
deportation is suspended for more than six months, however, the
Attorney General must furnish Congress the name of the person
involved and all of the facts and pertinent provisions of law in the
case. The information sent to the Congress is printed as a public
document. If during the time Congress is in session the two houses
pass a concurrent resolution stating in substance that the Congress
does not favor the suspension of such deportation, the Attorney
General is obligated to deport the alien in the manner provided
by law.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p>

<p>The Reciprocal Tariff Act of 1934 provides that prior to conclusion
of a foreign trade agreement reducing tariffs, reasonable public notice
of the intention to negotiate an agreement should be given in order
that any interested person might have an opportunity to communicate
his views to the President.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> A similar provision in the Emergency
Price Control Act of 1942 required, so far as practicable, consultation
by the President with members of affected industries prior to
establishment of maximum prices, and publication of such regulations
or orders accompanied by a statement of the considerations
involved in the issuance thereof.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>The remaining statutes simply provide for publication of agency
action, although in a context which indicates that publication could
be viewed as a check upon the agency’s discretion. The Coordinator
of Transportation, an office created by the Emergency Railroad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
Transportation Act of 1933, was required to make public in such
reasonable manner as he might determine orders which he issued
under the Act.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> The orders were to become effective not less than
twenty days from the date of publication<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> and in the interim interested
parties might file petitions asking that the order be reviewed
and suspended pending review.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> The Chairman of the War Production
Board, acting with the Attorney General, was given the
power with regard to the antitrust laws and the Federal Trade
Commission Act to temporarily suspend action against violators.
The Attorney General was required to order published in the
<cite>Federal Register</cite> every instance of the exercise of this power.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> The
Japanese Evacuation Claims Act of July 1948 provided that written
records of hearings, open to public inspection, be maintained.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> In
formulating new criteria for identification of a critical defense
housing area Congress, in the Housing and Rent Act of 1953, required
publication in the <cite>Federal Register</cite> of notices that before
applying the new criteria, a determination had been made to the
effect that a specified area constituted a critical defense housing
area.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Suppression of Information by Government</span></h3>

<p>Statutory provisions falling within this category may be subdivided
into four groupings: (a) exceptions to statutory reporting requirement;
(b) suspension of the requirement that contracts be let only
after public bidding; (c) suppression of information concerning patent
applications of military significance; (d) maintenance of secrecy of
testimony under certain conditions at the request of the person
testifying.</p>

<p><em>Exceptions to Statutory Reporting Requirements</em>: As chief recipient
of agency reports, Congress very obviously suffers the maximum
loss when it sanctions suppression of reporting requirements
in the interest of national security. Indicative of its sacrifice are
provisions in the Communications Act of 1934 authorizing the
Federal Communications Commission “to withhold publication of
records or proceedings containing secret information effecting the
national defense.”<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> Of like import is the requirement in a statute
delegating to the President power to authorize production, transfer
or export of war material by federal agencies. The Chief Executive
had to notify Congress at least every 90 days regarding war material
exports. He could withhold, however, whatever information disclosure
of which he deemed incompatible with the public interest.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
In the month following Pearl Harbor the Secretary of State was
authorized during the existence of a state of war to omit or dispense
with reports required by the Neutrality Act of 1939.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> In extending
the effect of certain emergency statutes Congress, in the Mutual
Security Act of 1951, permitted the President to submit biannual
reports on operations under the Act. He was privileged to exclude
from his report information, the disclosure of which he deemed
incompatible with the security of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a></p>

<p>To prevent information of value to the enemy from being disclosed
in litigation during World War II, Congress provided for staying of
judicial proceedings against the U.S. in time of war on claims
for damages caused by Navy vessels, or for towage or salvage
services to such vessels, when the Secretary of the Navy certified
that the prosecution of such proceedings would endanger the security
of naval operations or interfere therewith.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> Upon receipt of certification
courts were required to stay all further proceedings in a suit
until six months after the cessation of hostilities or until an approved
earlier date as stated in the certificate. The claimant could petition
the Secretary of the Navy to reconsider the stay, but his petition
was not to contain any recital of the facts or circumstances involved.
Identification of a petitioner’s case was to be solely by reference to
the Secretary’s certificate.<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p><em>Suspension of Financial Controls</em>: In a partially regulated
economy, advertising and competitive bidding on public contracts
benefit producer and taxpayer. These requirements insure relatively
equal access to public contracts by private entrepreneurs, minimize
nepotism or favoritism, and protect the public from extravagance.
In a controlled war economy advertising and public bidding very
probably would frustrate efforts to rationalize the productive facilities
of the nation, and certainly would present the enemy with valuable
intelligence. Indeed, intelligence considerations may lead to provision
for the secret letting of certain contracts, even in time of peace.</p>

<p>The chief of the supply service of the War Department was
authorized in 1936 to purchase materials for the Chemical Warfare
Service or the Signal Corps in whatever manner he deemed most
economical. This authority was delegated to the chief of the supply
service in order to prevent secret military information from being
divulged to the public.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> A 1939 Act to authorize the procurement,
without advertising, of certain aircraft parts and instruments or
aeronautical accessories, contained a similar provision.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> If a secret
order was necessary, the Secretary of War, after certification to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
that effect, could submit the proposed purchase to three reputable
concerns for their respective bids.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>After the fall of France, an act of June 28, 1940 to expedite national
defense authorized the Secretary of the Navy, whenever deemed
necessary by the President during the existing emergency, to negotiate
contracts with or without advertising or competitive bidding
upon determination that the price was fair and reasonable.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> A few
days later a more general statute gave the President plenary power
to authorize the War Department to purchase urgently needed
military hardware during the great national defense revival of 1940-41,
with or without reference to advertised bids.<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> As long as the
President could justify his actions as necessary “to provide for emergencies
affecting the national security and defense,” (and who, within
the Congress or among the public, had access to the information
essential to challenge the military necessity for given presidential
action), he had virtually a <i lang="fr">carte blanche</i> authority to write his own
ticket. The great atomic bomb project, involving the ultimate in
secrecy, was carried forward without the Congress being aware that
the two billion dollars subsequently appropriated for the Manhattan
Project were being expended for development of a weapon that
might never work.<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p>Title II of the First War Powers Act, enacted shortly after Pearl
Harbor, permitted the President to “authorize any department or
agency of the Government exercising functions in connection with
the prosecution of the war effort, ... to enter into contracts and into
amendments or modifications of contracts ... without regard to
the provisions of law”.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<p>Appropriation measures, as for example the Independent Offices
Appropriation Act of 1948, included funds to be expended for objects
of a confidential nature and required auditing officials to accept the
certificate of the expending agency as to the amount of the expenditure
and that it was deemed inadvisable to specify the nature thereof.<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>
Similarly, the National Military Establishment Appropriation Act
of 1950 stipulated that the determination of the propriety of expenditure
of the funds by the Secretaries of the military departments
should be final and conclusive upon the accounting officers of the
government. Payments from this appropriation might in the discretion
of the Secretary, be made on his certificate that the expenditures
were necessary for confidential military purposes.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> The Central
Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 granted the Central Intelligence
Agency a sweeping exemption “from the provisions of any law which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
requires the publication or disclosure of the organization, functions,
names, official titles, salaries, or numbers of personnel employed by
it,” and provided further that “the Director of the Bureau of the
Budget shall make no reports to the Congress in connection with
the Agency.”<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<p><em>Suppression of Information Concerning Inventions of Military Significance</em>:
Here an abridgment of a private economic right which is quasi-constitutional
in character is justified on grounds of security. The
Government appears to be concerned not so much with gaining access
to inventions as with suppression of the publication, particularly
abroad, of inventions of military value.<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a></p>

<p>A Congressional Act of July 1, 1940 states in part: “Whenever
the publication or disclosure of an invention by the granting of a
patent might, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Patents, be
detrimental to the public safety or defense he may order that the
invention be kept secret and withhold the grant of a patent for such
period or periods as in his opinion the national interest requires.”<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>Like provisions are contained in the Invention Secrecy Act of 1951.
When the head of a government agency holding a property interest
in an invention deems publication or disclosure by the grant of a
patent detrimental to the national security, the Secretary of Commerce,
as soon as notified, is required to order that the invention be
kept secret and withhold the patent therefore.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> When the Secretary
of Commerce believes that publication or disclosure of an invention
by the granting of a patent, in which the government does not have
a property interest, might be detrimental to the national security,
he must make the application for patent in which such invention
is disclosed available for inspection to the Atomic Energy Commission,
the Secretary of Defense, and the chief officer of any other department
or agency of the government designated by the President as a
defense agency of the United States. He must also issue a secrecy
order at the request of any of the defense agencies. Moreover, if
there is a proper showing by the head of the department or agency
who caused the secrecy order to be issued that the examination of
the application might jeopardize the national interest, the Secretary
of Commerce must maintain the application in a sealed condition and
notify the applicant accordingly.</p>

<p><em>Secrecy of Testimony</em>: Two statutes examined contained provisions
requiring or approving the suppression of information at the
request of persons who had provided it to emergency agencies. In
Section 202 thereof the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 authorized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
the Price Administrator to make investigations, subpoena witnesses,
and compel testimony upon the grant of immunity from prosecution.
The same Act also provided that the Administrator should not publish
or disclose any information obtained under the Act that the Administrator
deemed confidential or with reference to which a request
for confidential treatment had been made by the person furnishing
such information, unless he determined that the withholding thereof
was contrary to the interest of the national defense and security.<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>
This, of course, is the reverse of the usual requirement that information
be made public unless contrary to the interest of the national defense
and security. The Export Control Act of 1949 also contained a compulsory
testimony provision, with the requirement that, except as
necessary to the national interest, information given in such testimony
be kept confidential upon request of the witness.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Regulation of Propaganda Activities</span></h3>

<p>The Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, provided for public
disclosure by persons engaging in propaganda activities and other
activities for or on behalf of foreign governments, foreign political
parties, and other foreign principals so that the government and
the public could be informed of the identity of such persons and
could thereby appraise their statements and actions in the light of
their associations and activities.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> By virtue of a 1942 amendment
the necessity for foreign agents to register with the Attorney General
was waived for agents of allied and friendly nations and thus propaganda
efforts encouraged.<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> These agents could escape the registration
requirement provided they engaged only in activities which
were in furtherance of the policies, public interest, and national defense,
of their own government and the American government, and
were not intended to conflict with any of the domestic or foreign
policies of the United States. However, the agent had to be convinced
of the truth and accuracy of each communication or expression
which he made in this country.</p>

<p>Under the same Act persons required to register as foreign agents
also had to furnish the Library of Congress with two copies of any
political propaganda intended for dissemination to two or more
persons. This material had to be transmitted within forty-eight
hours after dissemination had begun and it had to be accompanied
by a statement, duly signed by or on behalf of the agent, setting
forth full information as to the places, times, and extent of actual
transmittal.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> In addition, the Act made it unlawful to disseminate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
the matter unless the political propaganda was conspicuously marked
at its beginning with, or prefaced or accompanied by, a true and
accurate statement, in the language or languages used in the political
propaganda. The Act further required that the person transmitting
political propaganda be registered under the Act with the Department
of Justice “as an agent of a foreign principal, together with the
name and address of the agent and of each of his foreign principals.”<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<p>The Internal Security Act of 1950 applied a similar requirement
to any organization registered as a Communist organization, or
ordered to register by the Subversive Activities Control Board.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>
Such an organization is guilty of a crime if it transmits through the
United States mails or by any means or instrumentality of interstate
or foreign commerce, any publication which is intended to be,
or which it is reasonably believed will be, circulated or disseminated
among at least two or more persons, unless the container in which
the publication is mailed contains this statement: “Disseminated
by ——, a Communist organization.” Programs sponsored by
Communist organizations on radio or television, in order to comply
with the Internal Security Act, must be preceded by the statement,
“the following program is sponsored by ——, a
Communist organization.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Censorship and Other Restrictions</span></h3>

<p>Thus far we have surveyed the discretionary power granted
government agencies, consistently with national defense to withhold
information from the public, the courts or the legislature, and those
powers accorded the executive branch to regulate or conditionally
promote propaganda activities of foreign nations. The following
section pertaining to censorship and other restrictions may be differentiated
from the foregoing as follows. Whereas the first section
dealt with government agencies as custodians of information, here
we are concerned with limitations imposed upon the efforts of individuals
and groups to secure information or to disseminate specified
kinds of information which they may possess.</p>

<p>The relevant statutes are reviewed under three headings. Certain
statutes prohibit the acquisition or attempted acquisition of specified
types of defense data. Others prohibit the dissemination of specified
kinds of information, or the communication of prescribed opinions.
A third group of statutes reflect the disposition of Congress to
empower the government to review and edit personal communications
media.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span></p>

<p><em>Illegal Acquisition of Defense Information</em>: In January 1938 the
President was authorized to define certain vital military and naval
installations or equipment requiring protection against the general
dissemination of information about them. It became unlawful
thereafter to make any photograph, sketch, picture, drawing, map,
or graphical representation of these vital military and naval installations
or equipment without first obtaining the permission of the
commanding officer of the installation concerned. If permission
were granted to anyone seeking information, it was necessary to
submit to censorship whatever information had been obtained.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a></p>

<p><em>Dissemination of Information and Proscribed Opinions</em>: The
same 1938 statute also made it illegal to reproduce, publish, sell, or
give away data without first obtaining official permission.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> The
Alien Registration Act of 1940 proscribed the advocacy of certain
opinions. It is unlawful for any person, with intent to interfere
with, impair, or influence the loyalty, morale, or discipline of the
military or naval forces of the United States by seeking to advise,
counsel, urge, or in any manner cause insubordination, disloyalty,
mutiny, or refusal of duty by any member of the military or naval
forces of the United States. And it is unlawful for any person to
distribute any written or printed matter which advises, counsels,
or urges insubordination, disloyalty or mutiny.<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> This Act also makes
it unlawful to knowingly or willfully seek the overthrow of any government
in the United States by direct or indirect action. Equally
proscribed is any effort which has as its goal the assassination of any
governmental official.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> Conspiracy to commit any of the acts enumerated
in the statute is also unlawful.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<p>The Export Control Act of 1949 gave the President power to
prohibit or curtail the export of technical data.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> Also pertinent is
the stipulation in an August 1953 statute permitting the government
to lend certain vessels to Italy, which prohibited the transmission to
Italy of information, plans, advise, material, documents, blueprints,
or other papers bearing a secret or top secret classification.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p>In 1951 legislation was enacted prohibiting disclosure of classified
information. It is unlawful knowingly and willingly to communicate,
furnish or transmit to an unauthorized person the following categories
of classified information: (1) codes, cipher or the cryptographic
system of the United States or any foreign government; (2) the
design, construction, use, maintenance, or repair of any device,
apparatus, or appliance used or prepared or planned for use by the
United States or any government for cryptographic or communication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
intelligence purposes; (3) the communication intelligence activities
of the United States or any foreign government; or (4) obtained by
the processes of communication intelligence from the communications
of any foreign government knowing the same to have been
obtained by such processes.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> Violators of this law can be fined up
to $10,000, be imprisoned for ten years, or suffer the imposition of
both penalties.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a></p>

<p>The Communist Organization Registration Act of July 1954 requires
organizations found by the Subversive Activities Control Board to
be Communist-action or Communist-front organizations to provide
the Attorney General a listing of all printing presses and machines.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>
The list of different kinds of presses is very extensive.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p><em>Censorship of Communications Media</em>: The War Powers Act
of December 1941 specifically empowered the President to establish
censorship of communications between the United States and
foreign countries. During the existence of the war, the President,
at his discretion, established rules and regulations for the censorship
of communications by mail, cable, radio, or other means of transmission
passing between the United States and any foreign country.
The authority to prescribe the rule by which censorship would be
applied, extended to communications carried by any vessel or other
means of transportation touching at any port, place, or territory
of the United States and bound to or from any foreign country.<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>A month later the Communications Act of 1934 was amended
to enable the President during time of war or threat of war to regulate
or close any or all facilities or stations for wire communication within
the jurisdiction of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> Nearly ten years later this
power was extended to any or all stations or devices capable of
emitting electromagnetic radiations within the jurisdiction of the
United States.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> The power to close stations for radio communication
within the jurisdiction of the United States included those suitable
as navigational aids beyond five miles of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Acquisition of Information by the Government</span></h3>

<p>Examined herein are statutes requiring private persons or groups
to report their activities to government agencies, or compelling them
to testify before such agencies; and providing for the conduct or study
of experiments by government agencies, including congressional
committees, for the purpose of obtaining certain information. Other
measures provide for a variety of investigations, inventories, audits,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
etc., to be conducted by government agencies and congressional
committees, and intelligence.</p>

<p><em>Compulsory Reporting</em>:<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> Compulsory reporting on an occasional
or periodic basis, it is generally assumed, constitutes an effective
enforcement device. Thus to aid the President in effectively exercising
the powers granted therein, the Bank Conservation Act of
1933<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> provided that he might require specific, detailed, and confidential
information to be given under oath by any person then engaged in
the banking business. The President could require the production
of private papers, letters, contracts, books of account or other papers
in the custody of the person required to produce them. Not until
a very detailed and thorough examination of the information sought
had been completed, could an accurate report be prepared in compliance
with the Act.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> The National Industrial Recovery Act permitted
the President to impose such conditions (including requirements
for the making of reports, the keeping of records and the
keeping of accounts) for the protection of consumers, competitors,
employees, and others, and in furtherance of the public interest as
he saw fit, as a condition of approval of codes of fair competition.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>
Another section of the Act required trade or industrial associations,
if they were to receive the benefit of exemption from antitrust prosecution,
to file a statement with the President in accordance with
regulations promulgated by the Chief Executive.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> The Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 similarly required periodical reporting<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> as did
the 1935 enactment directed at preventing the interstate shipment
of contraband oil.<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p>The first Neutrality Act imposed upon all persons required to
register with the National Munitions Control Board an obligation
to maintain permanent records of all arms, ammunition and implements
of war manufactured for importation and exportation under
the rules prescribed by the Board.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> The requirement was continued
in the 1937 Amendment which designated the Secretary of State
(Chairman of the N.M.C.B. under the old and the amended Act)
as recipient of the information to be submitted.<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> The Foreign
Agents Registration Act of 1938 (as amended in April 1942) not
only required the filing of registration statements by agents of foreign
powers, but compelled each registered agent to keep and preserve
books of account and other records which he was required to disclose
under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General.<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<p>As to procurement statutes, Congress, in connection with a 1934
enactment directed against excessive profit-making or collusive bidding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
in connection with naval construction contracts, required
contractors to agree, as a condition of receiving a navy contract, to
submit reports which would show conformance or non-conformance
with the provisions of the Act.<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> The Second War Powers Act of
1942 followed up the grant of power to exact priorities with a section
entitling the President to obtain a wide variety of information from
any persons holding defense contracts. Contractors were required
to keep accurate records in readiness for whatever accounting the
President might eventually request.<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p><em>Authorization for the Conduct or Study of Experiments</em>: The
Tennessee Valley Authority Act authorized the T.V.A. to establish
the physical plants necessary to undertake experiments for the
production of nitrogen products for military and agricultural uses.
Such experiments were to emphasize both economy and high
standards of efficiency.<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> A 1938 statute authorizing the construction
of naval vessels included provision for the construction of experimental
vessels and the construction of a rigid airship of American
design and American construction.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> Implementing the latter,
appropriations were authorized for the purpose of rotary-wing and
other aircraft research, development, procurement, experimentation,
and operation for service testing.<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>The National Science Foundation was established in 1950 as an
independent agency, but within the executive branch of government.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>
Functions of this Foundation include promotion of basic
research and education in the sciences, initiation and support of basic
scientific research, initiation and support at the request of the
Secretary of Defense of specific scientific research activities in connection
with matters relating to the national defense, evaluation of
scientific research programs undertaken by agencies of the federal
government, and correlation of the Foundation’s work with that
of private and public research groups or individuals.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> The functions
enumerated do not exhaust the total of those assigned to the above
mentioned agency.</p>

<p>In 1952 Congress authorized construction of aeronautical research
facilities by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. These
facilities were to be used for the effective prosecution of aeronautical
research. The Committee could expand certain of its experimental
facilities especially since one of the purposes of the Act was to promote
the national defense.<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> A similar kind of statute enacted in 1953
created an Advisory Committee on Weather Control. The function
of this Committee was to make a complete study and evaluation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
of public and private experiments in weather control for the purpose
of determining the extent to which the United States should experiment
with, or engage in, or regulate activities designed to control
weather conditions.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> It was to correlate and evaluate the information
derived from experimental activity and to cooperate with
the several States in encouraging the intelligent experimentation
and the beneficial development of weather modification and control.
In carrying out these objectives, the Committee was also required
to keep a “weather eye” on seeing to it that harmful and indiscriminate
techniques for weather control were not fostered.<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Government Investigations, Inventories, Audits</span></h3>

<p>Statutory provisions in this category are classifiable as follows:
investigations, inventories, audits, etc., (a) incidental to program
development or enforcement; (b) precedent to the establishment
of policy in certain fields; (c) designed to aid specified agency clientele
(private groups); (d) accusatory in nature; (e) military intelligence.</p>

<p><em>Investigations Incidental to Program Development or Enforcement</em>:
The Economy Act passed in the first month of the Roosevelt administration
effected reductions in government pensions and salaries
with a view to reducing the cost of Federal operations. Salary reductions
were to vary with fluctuations in a cost of living index to be
ascertained through investigation by government agencies.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> The
Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, in setting up an emergency
program for the rehabilitation of growers of certain commodities
directed the Secretary of Agriculture to make investigations and such
reports to the President concerning the program as appeared necessary
to its execution. In conjunction with the National Industrial Recovery
Act of June 1933 was a 1934 amendment which authorized
the President to establish a board or boards to investigate issues,
facts, practices, or activities of employers or employees in any
controversies arising under section 7 (a) of the statute which were
burdening, obstructing, or threatening to burden or obstruct, the
free flow of interstate commerce.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></p>

<p>The Second War Powers Act required the Secretary of Commerce,
under Presidential direction, to make such special investigations
and reports of census or statistical matters as might be needed in
connection with conduct of the war. The Act imposed a penalty
against anyone who refused to answer questions, gave false statements
or deliberately neglected to answer questions asked by Departmental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
subordinates in the conduct of investigations.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> It also accorded
the government the right to inspect the plants and audit the books
of defense contractors.<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p>Before presenting to a court a certificate requesting a stay of judicial
proceedings on claims for damages caused by naval vessels
during the War, the Secretary of the Navy had to conduct an investigation
of the case in order to satisfy himself that the issuance of
the certificate was necessary.<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> A principal purpose of the Employment
Act of 1946 was the establishment of an agency to investigate
and report upon the current state of the national economy.<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> The
Housing and Rent Act of 1948 specified that the Housing Expediter
should make surveys from time to time with a view to decontrolling
housing accommodations at the earliest practicable date.<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> The
Federal Civil Defense Administrator is charged by the statute creating
the Federal Civil Defense Administration with responsibility
to prepare national plans and programs, and to request reports on
state plans directed at fulfillment of the objectives of the Act.<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<p><em>Policy Development</em>: A number of statutes contain provisions
designed to satisfy congressional need for information as an aid in
policy-making. A joint resolution of April 1934 directed the Federal
Power Commission to investigate the rates charged by private
and municipal corporations, prepare a compilation of the respective
rate structures and submit the information requested to the Congress
as quickly as possible. In making its compilation, the Commission
was requested to submit any analysis it had made of the difference
in rates charged between the privately owned and publicly owned
utilities.<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> The Commission might require reports and testimony
from private power officials and was given the right to examine and
copy any documentary evidence relative to the sale of electrical
energy or its service to consumers by any corporation engaged in
the sale of electricity.<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> Collecting accurate and comprehensive
information regarding the rates charged for electrical energy and its
service to residential, rural, commercial and industrial consumers
throughout the United States<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> was directed toward satisfying needs
of both the agency and the Congress.</p>

<p>Again in 1934, Congress established a Commission to make an
immediate study and survey of aviation and its relation to the United
States and to report to Congress its recommendations of a broad
policy covering all phases of aviation and its significance to the
United States.<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> The Railroad Retirement Board was directed to make
specific recommendations for such changes in the retirement system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
created by the Railroad Retirement Act of 1934 as would assure the
adequacy and permanency of the retirement system on the basis of
its experience and all information and experience then available.
For this purpose the Board was directed from time to time to make
investigations and actuarial studies necessary to provide the fullest
information practicable for the Board’s report and recommendation.<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>
In the third year of World War II a Joint Committee on Organization
of Congress was established. The Joint Committee was given the
responsibility of preparing a full and complete study of the organization
and operation of the Congress together with recommendations
for improvement in its organization and operation. Congress sought
from the study and report the means for strengthening the Legislative
branch of the government by simplifying its operation, improving
relations between the Congress and other branches of government,
and enabling it to better meet its responsibilities under the Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>
While some of the more archaic rules under which the
Congress operated, indeed to some extent still does operate, were
long overdue for a complete overhaul, the more immediate stimulus
to action arose from a candid and searching appraisal of Congress’
inability to stem the rising tide of government by the
executive. The demands of emergency government of all kinds
even before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, tended to reduce
the role of the Congress to that of mere ratification of executive
action, the latter usually taken without regard to possible Congressional
objections. Reorganization of the Congress resulting from the
Joint Committee study and report was in response to a growing
awareness of the need to improve the functioning of Congress as
an organ for control of a wartime executive.</p>

<p>An important recent statute within this category is the Civil
Rights Act of 1957.<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> This Act created a Commission on Civil Rights,
empowered only to investigate, to study, to appraise and make findings
and recommendations. It was not to be a Commission for the
enforcement of civil rights. Specifically, the Civil Rights Act of 1957
directed the Commission to:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“(1) investigate allegations in writing under oath or affirmation
that certain citizens of the United States are being deprived of
their right to vote and have that vote counted by reason of their
color, race, religion, or national origin, which writing, under oath
or affirmation, shall set forth the facts upon which such belief or
beliefs are based;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span></p>

<p>“(2) study and collect information concerning legal developments
constituting a denial of equal protection of the laws under the Constitution;
and</p>

<p>“(3) appraise the laws and policies of the Federal Government
with respect to equal protection of the laws under the Constitution.”<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Commission was instructed to submit to the President and
Congress a comprehensive report of its activities, findings, and
recommendations not later than two years from the enactment of
the Act. The Commission’s report was submitted to the Congress on
September 9, 1959,<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> just in time to win the Commission a two year
lease on life.</p>

<p>Many of the statutes in this category are directed at securing
information on which to base natural resources or scarce materials
policy. In 1947 the President was requested to prepare, through the
appropriate departments of the Government, a comprehensive plan
for the development of the resources of Alaska, and the expansion
and development of the facilities of commerce between the United
States and Alaska and within the Territory. The President was
requested to have the report ready for the consideration of the second
session of the Seventy-fifth Congress thirty-five days after Congress
reconvened.<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

<p>A strategic materials stockpiling statute of 1939 directed the
Secretary of the Interior through the Director of the Bureau of
Mines and the Director of the Geological Survey to make scientific,
technological, and economic investigations concerning the extent and
mode of occurrence, the development, mining, of ores and other
mineral substances found in the United States which were considered
essential to the common defense or the industrial needs of the United
States.<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> Preparatory to enacting definitive post-war legislation
establishing United States policy with regard to the domestic rubber-producing
industry, Congress in 1947 provided for the conduct of a
thorough study of the field.<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Under the Rubber Producing Facilities
Disposal Act of 1953 the Rubber Producing Facilities Disposal Commission
was created and granted access to all available information
concerning the Government-owned rubber-producing facilities in the
possession of any department, agency, officer, Government corporation,
or instrumentality of the United States concerned with Government-owned
rubber-producing facilities.<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> Included in the data it was
required to furnish the Congress was an inventory report concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
the Government’s current stocks of synthetic rubber and its component
materials.<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>Endeavoring to expand production of abaca within the Western
Hemisphere, Congress in 1950 authorized such surveys and research
as were necessary or desirable to obtain the best available land in
the Western Hemisphere for abaca production.<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p><em>Information-Gathering For the Aid of Agency Clientele</em>: In 1938
Congress set up the Mediterranean Fruit Fly Board to conduct a
complete investigation and survey of all losses sustained by growers
and farmers in the State of Florida resulting from the campaign
to eradicate the Mediterranean fruit fly within the State.<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> It carefully
stipulated that the Board’s report did not bind Congress legally
or morally to grant relief to the affected farmers.<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<p>Like the farmer, the small businessman receives his full share of
congressional consideration. For the sake of the nation and the small
businessman, the Small Business Concerns Mobilization Act of June
1942 sought to integrate him into the war effort.<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> It created the
Smaller War Plants Corporation and included among its functions
that of making studies with respect to the means by which small business
concerns may be supplied with essential raw materials and
receive fair and reasonable treatment from all Government departments
without interfering with the efficiency of the war-production
program.<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> In liquidating the Reconstruction Finance Corporation
in July 1953, Congress substituted for it the Small Business Administration,
which, among other things, was to obtain information as to
methods and practices which Government prime contractors utilize
in letting subcontracts and to take action to encourage the letting
of subcontracts by prime contractors to small-business concerns.<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>
It was also to make a complete inventory of all productive facilities
of small-business concerns which could be used for war or defense
production, or to arrange for the inventory to be made by any other
governmental agency which has the facilities.<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> Further, it could
obtain from suppliers of materials information pertaining to the
method of filling orders and the bases for allocating their supply,
whenever it appeared that any small business is unable to obtain
materials from its normal sources for war or defense production. And
it was directed to make studies and recommendations to the appropriate
federal agencies to insure a fair and equitable share of materials,
supplies, and equipment to small-business concerns in order to effectuate
war or defense programs.<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> On the other hand, as a condition
to securing loans from the Administration, small business concerns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
must certify to it the names of any attorneys, agents, or other persons
engaged by or on behalf of such business enterprise for the purpose
of expediting applications made to the Administration for assistance
of any sort, and the fees paid or to be paid to any such persons.<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>

<p><em>Accusatory Action</em>: The two items of legislation involved here—one
a joint resolution, the other a concurrent resolution—extended
the statute of limitations as it affected “the possible prosecution of
any person or persons, military or civilian, connected with the Pearl
Harbor catastrophe of December 7, 1941”<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> and created a joint congressional
committee to make a full and complete investigation of
the facts relating to the events and circumstances leading up to or
following the attack made by Japanese armed forces upon Pearl
Harbor on December 7, 1941.<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a></p>

<p><em>Intelligence</em>: The obvious example here is the statute setting up
the Central Intelligence Agency in 1947. Its Director was intrusted
with responsibility for protecting intelligence sources and methods
from unauthorized disclosure and for operating an American intelligence
network.<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Protecting Freedom of Communication</span></h3>

<p>It would be distorting the picture not to take into account those
instances in which Congress displayed concern lest the control programs
it enacted would constrict freedom of communication. Thus
while the Price administrator had the power to require licenses of
anybody selling commodities regulated by his office, his power did
not extend to various media of communication. The selling or distributing
of newspapers, periodicals, books or printed or written material,
motion pictures or radio time were exempted from the license requirement.<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>
The Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1951
permits any member of the Armed Forces to communicate directly
or indirectly with any Member of Congress. The statute expressly
forbids any one from restricting or preventing a serviceman from
writing to his Congressman or Senator. The only limitation placed
on such communication is that the subject matter does not violate
the law or the regulations necessary to the security and safety of the
United States.<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter VIII</span>
<br><span class="cheaderfont">LEGISLATIVE RESTRAINTS ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF EMERGENCY POWERS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It is generally conceded that the problem of the responsibility of
administrative officials in a democracy is the very crux of the problem
of the maintenance of the democratic system,<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> and that we must look
chiefly to the Congress for performance of the task of happily combining
administrative responsibility with the administrative discretion
so vital to the maintenance of the democratic government in time of
peace or war. Members and critics of the federal legislature, particularly
since the 77th or first wartime Congress (1941-1942), have
acknowledged and responded to the need to equip it more effectively
to formulate basic policy as well as to scrutinize administrative execution
of the legislative mandate.<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> As appraised by these critics
the problem is one of adequately and accurately informing the
Congress,<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> of concentrating congressional checks upon essentials
rather than trivia,<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> and, in contradiction of those who seek an unchecked
executive discretion in time of emergency, of “including
closer, stronger, steadier cooperation between the President and the
Congress.”<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>Among recent innovations which may be viewed as the product of
this movement to perfect administrative accountability to Congress
are the requirements of executive reporting to the Legislative Branch
and the “legislative veto.” Whether statutes embodying these devices
provide Congress with a check on the Executive Branch in excess of
that deemed essential, and in effect, accord to the Legislative Branch
an actual participation in the administration of the laws is the major
issue to which this chapter is devoted.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Accounting to Committees</span></h3>

<p>In the course of signing H. R. 6042, a defense appropriations bill,
on July 15, 1955, President Eisenhower rebuked Congress for including
therein Section 638 requiring the Secretary of Defense to
secure prior consent of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees
before separating from his Department functions which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
thinks could better be performed by private industry. The President
alleged that the Congress has no right to confer upon its committees
the power to veto Executive action or to prevent Executive action
from becoming effective. Invoking the constitutional principle of the
separation of powers, he declared his intention to ignore this provision.<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>While the bill which President Eisenhower reluctantly signed
represented an effort to delegate a share in the executive function to
committees of the Congress, such legislative action is not wholly
without precedent. A survey of legislation in the fields of foreign
affairs and economic or military emergency since 1933 indicates not
infrequent attempts by Congress to secure for its committees some
measure of continuing influence over the exercise of powers delegated
to the executive. This may take the form of requiring periodic
or special reports to policy committees instead of the full houses,
it may take the form of compulsory consultation with committees—and
whatever this entails by way of consequent committee influence
on administrative action, or the committee may be secured a suspensive,
enabling, or veto power over administrative action. It would be
rash to construct, on the basis of our study, a judgment of the potential
good or evil attending the increasing effort of Congress to share
the detailed burdens of administration. The trend, it seems clear,
exists, however.</p>

<p><em>Reporting to Committees</em>: The requirement that administrative
units report to superiors, to Congress, or to units of the latter, may be
designed to achieve many purposes. The requirement may be devoid
of any overtone of control—e.g., its aim may be limited solely to
providing of technical information or advice as an aid to policy
formulation, or it may be utilized to promote maximum scrutiny
and control of executive action. For when one must report in detail and
frequently on the discharge of delegated functions, it is necessary either
to attempt to mislead the Congress—a dangerous pastime—or to toe
the line and act as a meticulous surrogate of the legislature, in anticipation
of an imminent accounting with it.</p>

<p>Thus it would be difficult to distinguish the informative and control
purposes of the provision of the Supplemental National Defense Appropriations
Act of 1948 requiring that the Secretary of Defense report
quarterly “to the Committees on Appropriations and Armed Services
of the Congress ... the amounts obligated” for “the construction
of aircraft and equipment.”</p>

<p>The Secretary’s reports were to include a statement of finding
by the President that the contracts let were necessary in the interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
of the national defense and that the contract specifications insured
the maximum utilization of improvements in aircraft and equipment
consistent with the defense needs of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> The Mutual
Defense Assistance Act of 1949 permitted the President, upon his
own determination of the need therefore, to transfer funds from one
project to another provided for in the Act. The amounts transferred
could not exceed five percent of the total funds appropriated.<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>
Whenever he made such a determination, however, he was required
forthwith to notify the Committee on Foreign Relations of the
Senate, the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and of
the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs
own determination of the need therefore, to transfer funds from one
to report to the Congress biannually on the administration <a id="Ref_95" href="#BRef_95">of the
Act.</a><a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>
    The Mutual Security Act of 1951 contained a similar provision.<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a></p>

<p>Similar to the above is the 1950 requirement that the Secretary
of the Navy annually file with the Committees on Armed Services
in the Congress information as to the proceeds of all sales of condemned
naval material and the expenses connected with such sales.<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>
The 1950 statute permitting the summary suspension of civilian
officers and employees of specified departments and agencies (State,
Commerce, Justice, Defense, Treasury, Atomic Energy Commission,
National Security Resources Board, National Advisory Committee
for Aeronautics) gave the President authority to extend the list of
agencies to which the Act applied. Any additions to the list, however,
had to be based upon the best interests of national security and
communicated to the Committees on the Armed Services of the
Congress.<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p>

<p>In the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1951, which established
an embargo on the shipment of arms, ammunition, and implements
of war to any nation or combination of nations threatening the
security of the United States, Congress gave the Administration the
power to determine what items constituted arms, ammunition, and
implements of war and items should be embargoed.<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> Aid to any
nation knowingly permitting shipment of such materials or equipment
to the U.S.S.R. and its satellites was to be suspended, unless the
President found that unusual circumstances indicated that the
cessation of aid would clearly be detrimental to the security of the
United States. Upon making such a decision, the President was to
report his decision and the reasons for it to the Appropriations and
Armed Services Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives,
the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.
Moreover, the President was required to review, at least once each
quarter, all determinations made previously and report his conclusions
to the foregoing committees.<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<p>A postwar statute of limited dimensions was enacted in August
1953, enabling the President to lend to Italy, France, and any friendly
foreign nation in the Far Eastern area, on terms satisfactory to him,
naval vessels of stated categories.<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> This legislation charged the
Secretary of Defense with the duty to keep the respective Committees
on Armed Service of the Senate and the House of Representatives
advised of all transfers or other dispositions of naval vessels.<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> The
Defense Cataloguing and Standardization Act of 1952 established within
the Department of Defense a Defense Supply Management Agency
which was to develop a single catalogue system and related supply
standardization program.<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> The Director of the Agency was required
to transmit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate
and House of Representatives on January 31 and July 31 of each
year, progress reports on the cataloguing and standardization programs.<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>
Similarly, in authorizing the Secretaries of the Army, Navy,
and Air Force to acquire or develop industrial plants as needed for
defense mobilization Congress required the Secretary of Defense
to report semi-annually to the Committees on Armed Services of the
Senate and of the House of Representatives with respect to those
activities authorized by statute which were not otherwise the subject
of reporting under law.<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

<p>The foregoing can perhaps best be characterized as legislative
adaptations of Carl J. Friedrich’s so-called “rule of anticipated reaction.”<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>
In context the rule implies that administrative officers,
aware of the imminent necessity of reporting to the legislature the
details of exercise of discretion under delegatory statutes, will attempt
so to pattern their action as to maximize the likelihood of legislative
approval.</p>

<p><em>Consultation with Committees</em>: Legislative restraint is less obvious—though
nonetheless present—in statutes which, instead of requiring
detailed reporting of administrative discharge of delegated
functions, provide for periodic or continuous administrative consultation
with congressional committees. The Economic Co-operation
Act of 1948 created a Joint Committee on Foreign Economic Co-operation,
consisting of ten members from the Foreign Relations and
Appropriations Committees of the Senate, and the Foreign Affairs
and Appropriations Committees of the House. The Economic Cooperation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Administrator was to consult with the committee from
time to time as the Committee might request.<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> In 1950 the Secretary
of Defense was empowered after consultation with the respective
Armed Services Committees of the Congress to provide the facilities
necessary or the administration and training of the Reserve components
of the Armed Forces.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> The Defense Production Act of 1950
established a Joint Committee of Defense Production to make a continuous
study of the programs authorized by the Act, and to review
the progress achieved in the execution and administration of such
programs. It required all agencies and officials administering programs
authorized by the Act, at the request of the committee, to consult with
the committee, from time to time, with respect to their activities under
this Act.<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> A Joint Committee on Immigration and Nationality Policy
was created to make a continuous study of the administration of the
Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> The Act instructed the
Attorney General and the Secretary of State to submit to the Committee
all regulations, instructions, and all other information as
requested by the Committee relative to the administration of the Act.
The Secretary of State and the Attorney General were required to
consult with the Committee from time to time with respect to their
activities under this Act.<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<p><em>Committee Participation in Administrative Decision-Making</em>: The
history of recent use of the “legislative veto” might lead one to
expect that, in those instance in which it seeks to retain a power
of continuous oversight of administration action, Congress would be
prone to locate this function in either or both houses rather than
to delegate it to committees. However, the fiscal 1956 Defense Appropriations
Act, earlier mentioned, is by no means the first instance
in which committees have been assigned the function of participating
in administrative decision-making. In fact, careful study of the
functioning of Congressional Committees might reveal that compulsory
consultation and joint committee-agency decision-making are
more the rule than the exception.<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

<p>Certainly Congress, in requiring the Atomic Energy Commission to
report to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy any instances in
which it imparted atomic secrets to other nations, contemplated
committee control of such action. Arrangements with other nations
were not to be consummated until the Joint Committee on Atomic
Energy had been fully informed for a period of thirty days in which
the Congress was in session.<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> If the Committee disapproved the
arrangement and found the Commission unresponsive to its influence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
the former would have time in which to report this fact to Congress.</p>

<p>When it authorized the establishment of a long-range proving
ground for guided missiles in 1949, Congress stipulated that prior to
the acquiring of lands under this law the Secretary of the Air Force
had to come “into agreement with the Armed Services Committees
of the Senate and the House of Representatives with respect to
the acquisition of such lands.”<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> This clearly established a joint
committee-agency decision-making arrangement. A 1951 statute
required the Secretaries of the Army, Air Force, and Navy, and the
Federal Civil Defense Administrator, to come into agreement with
the two Armed Services Committees whenever real estate actions by or
for the use of the military departments or the Federal Civil Defense
Administration were involved.<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> The Emergency Powers Interim
Continuation Act of July 1952, continued this provision in force.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p>In conclusion we mention a device for securing to congressional
committees a form of suspensive power over administrative action.
This is the familiar provision for suspension of deportation orders
where either the Immigration and Naturalization Committee of the
House or of the Senate Committee on Immigration has favorably
acted on a bill for the relief of the alien in question. The Act cited
here was restricted in effect to the Seventy-fifth Congress, and stays
of deportation under it were to be terminated at least by the date
of adjournment of the first regular session of the Seventy-sixth
Congress.<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Accounting to Congress</span></h3>

<p>The preponderance of relevant data collected under this particular
head consists of routine requirements, inserted in delegatory
statutes, that administrators periodically report to the Congress
on the discharge of their functions. It need hardly be stressed that
by this method of acquiring information Congress not only equips
itself with data vitally prerequisite to its exercise of the function of
oversight, but that its demand for such information in itself represents
a form of control. The necessity of periodic reporting interposes
an effective psychological hurdle between the administrator
and intentional malfeasance. Certain reporting provisions clearly
reflect a desire to maintain a continuous check upon the administration;
others appear directed more at securing information and advice
as an aid to policy-making.</p>

<p><em>Reporting Administrative Activity</em>: In delegating powers in the
areas of defense, foreign affairs or in time of emergency, Congress is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
inclined to insist upon frequent reporting, and to specify carefully
the kind of information and supporting documentation it expects
to receive. It may stipulate, as in the Japanese Evacuation Claims
Act of 1948 and the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949, the
subjects on which it wishes reports, and refrain from imposing an
obligation to report at specified calendar intervals. The Japanese
Claims Act instructed the Attorney General to submit to Congress
a full and complete statement of all adjudications, name and address
of each claimant, the amount of the settlement and a brief synopsis
of the facts of each claim case and the reasons for each adjudication.<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>
A 1935 statute required that the Secretary of the Navy report to
Congress at the next regular session thereof all expenditures on
ship repairs in excess of the amounts specified by appropriations
legislation.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> In April, 1937 the Secretary of Agriculture was granted
one million dollars to “be expended for the control of grasshoppers,
Mormon crickets or cinch bugs,” and required to report to Congress
on his handling of the fund.<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> Similarly, in establishing an emergency
fund for the President in 1940, to enable him to furnish government-owned
facilities to privately owned plants and procure and train
civilian personnel in the production of critical materials, Congress
stipulated that an account be kept of all expenditures made from the
fund and required that a report on the condition of the fund be submitted
to the Congress on or before June 30, 1942.<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a></p>

<p>The Federal Emergency Relief Act of 1933 went so far as to require
the Federal Emergency Relief Administrator to print a report of
his activities and expenditures monthly, and submit them to the
President and the Congress.<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> The foregoing, like the statute of
June 1942, mobilizing small business concerns for war production,
which provided for reports to Congress by the Attorney General
at least once every quarter (“not less frequently than once every
one hundred and twenty days”<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>) is somewhat unusual. Standard
practice requires quarterly,<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> biannual,<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>
    or annual reporting. Annual
reporting may be in terms of a report to be submitted to both houses
of Congress “on the first day of”<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> or “at the beginning of”<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> each
regular session of Congress. However, it more likely will be phrased
an “annual report.”<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a></p>

<p>Congress sometimes requires great specificity in administrative
reporting. Exemplifying such demands are the following statutes.
A 1950 statute limited the number of Army officers who might be
assigned to permanent duty in the Department of the Army and
the number who could be assigned to the Army General Staff at any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
one time. The Secretary of the Army is required to report quarterly
to the Congress the number of officers and the justification therefor.<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>
This is a simple but extremely precise reporting requirement. The
May, 1937 amendment to the Neutrality Act more generally defined
and described the various topics to be covered in the annual report
of the National Munitions Control Board, but stipulated that the
report contain a list of all persons required to register under the
provisions of the Act, and full information concerning the licenses
which had been issued thereunder.<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> A like blend of liberality and
rigidity in stipulating the content of reports was manifested in a
1937 Act designed to establish a government monopoly of the production
of helium gas.<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> The National Munitions Control Board
was to include in its Annual Report to the Congress full information
concerning the export licenses issued thereunder and whatever additional
information and data the Board considered of value in the
determination of questions related to the exportation of helium gas.<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a></p>

<p>The Secretary of the Navy was directed in 1938 to report annually
to the Congress all agreements entered into for leasing naval petroleum
reserves;<a id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> and a 1939 statute to facilitate certain construction
work for the Army required the Secretary of War to report annually
to the Congress all contracts entered into under authority of the
Act, including the names of the contractors and copies of the contracts
concerned, together with the amounts involved.<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> The Sixth
Supplemental National Defense Appropriation Act of 1942 established
the duty of the Secretary of War and Secretary of the Navy to
submit a complete list of all contracts awarded in excess of $150,000
together with the names of the contractors, and the subject matter
of each contract. If the contract had been awarded without competitive
bidding, the Secretaries had to supply Congress with a statement
of the principal or controlling reason for selection of the contractors.
Reports had to be submitted within sixty days after the
end of the fiscal year.<a id="FNanchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></p>

<p>In the main the congressional requirement of reporting is cast
in general terms, permitting the administrator considerable discretion
as to content and precise date (if not periodicity) of submission.
On occasion, however, Congress is disposed to insist upon
specificity in exacting reports from agencies, particularly agencies
assigned such tasks as the registering of individuals, licensing, letting
contracts, and the like.</p>

<p><em>Informing and Advising the Congress</em>: A large number of statutes
require reports which appear not so much directed at enforcing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
responsibility on the part of executive agencies as eliciting information
and specialized advice for policy-making. In 1934 Congress required
the Federal Power Commission to submit a report and analysis of rate
schedules charged by private and municipal utility companies at the
earliest practicable date.<a id="FNanchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> The Tennessee Valley Authority Act<a id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>
contains a reporting requirement commonly found in legislation
pertaining to newly established programs. The President was directed
to recommend to Congress such legislation as he deemed proper to
carry out the general purposes stated in the law.<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> His recommendations
were to be made from time to time as work progressed. In
1934 Congress authorized the President “to appoint a Commission
composed of five members ... for the purpose of making an immediate
study and survey, and to report to Congress not later than February 1,
1935, its recommendations of a broad policy covering all phases of
aviation and the relation of the United States thereto.”<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> In setting
up the Federal Communications Commission in 1934 Congress indicated
that it expected the Commission’s annual reports to contain
information and advice facilitating further congressional policy-making
in the communications field. The Commission was directed
to prepare an annual report for the Congress which would contain
information and data collected by the Commission considered to
be of value in the determination of questions connected with the
Commission’s regulatory responsibilities involving wire and radio
communication and radio transmission of energy. The Commission
was also required to submit recommendations for additional legislation
in the report if the Commission believed it necessary. And
on February 1, 1935 the Commission was specifically directed to make
a special report to the Congress recommending amendments to the
F.C.C. Act.<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p>

<p>In the Price Control Act of 1946 Congress indicated its desire
that the control of prices be terminated as rapidly as possible, and
directed the President to recommend to the Congress whatever
was judged by him as needed to supplement the control of prices
and wages during the remainder of 1947.<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> The national emergency
provisions of the Labor Management Relations Act provide that
upon exhaustion of the procedures for deferring and attempting
settlement of national emergency strikes “the President shall submit
to the Congress a full and comprehensive report of the proceedings ...
together with such recommendations as he may see fit to make for
consideration and appropriate action.”<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> A final illustration is drawn
from the June, 1951 amendments to the Universal Military Training<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
and Service Act. This measure established a National Security
Training Commission of five members which, in addition to generally
supervising the training of the National Security Training Corps,
was to submit to the Congress certain legislative recommendations.
These recommendations were to include, but not be limited to—(a)
a broad outline for a program to assure that the training be of a
military nature, (b) measures for the personal safety, health, welfare
and morals of members of the Corps and (c) a code of conduct.<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Concurrent Resolution</span></h3>

<p>The suggestion has been made that Congress would be better
informed and could exercise a more adequate check upon the administration
of delegated powers “if the major rules and regulations
of the agencies were submitted to Congress under a provisional order
system. Under this system they would become effective after a
certain time, unless negatived by Congress.”<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> This would in effect
adapt to American purposes the provisions of the British Statutory
Instrument Act of 1946, requiring that important administrative
rules and regulations issued under delegatory statutes be submitted
to the Parliament, where they would be reviewed by a “Scrutiny
Committee” of the Commons.</p>

<p>The resultant veto power might be exercised in a number of
ways. A congressional committee might be given power to scrutinize
and report on such rules and regulations, or delegated a final power
to approve or disapprove. We have earlier noted the extent to which
Congress has equipped committees with a power to review and approve
or disapprove administrative action.</p>

<p>Were Congress to utilize the Joint Resolution as an instrument for
approving or disapproving administrative action, no innovation would
be involved. The Joint Resolution requires presidential signature to
become effective. This legislative instrument traditionally has been
relied upon to clarify congressional intent in delegatory statutes which
it thought had been misinterpreted by administrative agencies or the
courts. However, if in delegating powers to the executive, Congress
conditioned the grant by reserving power to itself by concurrent resolution
or by simple resolution of one house to define the terms under
which the executive was to act and to review, approve or disapprove
such administrative action, a signal departure from established practice
would be recorded. In effect, the Congress would have retained the
power to curb administration through legislative procedures which
do not require Presidential signature to be effective, and which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
traditionally do not have the force of law, serving simply to express
the intent of the Congress.<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></p>

<p>While the Constitution provides that “every order, resolution, or
vote to which the concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives
may be necessary ... shall be presented to the President ...
and before (they) take effect shall be approved by him,” concurrent
resolutions have not for over a century and a quarter been submitted
for presidential approval.<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> Apparently the earliest use of the concurrent
resolution as a device for enhancing the ability of Congress
to control administrative action is to be found in the Reorganization
Act of 1932, followed by the Reorganization Act of 1939.<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> These
statutes empowered the President to submit reorganization plans to
Congress, the plans to have legal effect unless disapproved by concurrent
resolution adopted within a prescribed period.</p>

<p>Within the past two decades all three instruments—the joint
resolution, the concurrent resolution, and the simple resolution
passed by one house—have been used by Congress in an attempt to
retain influence and control over the administration of emergency
programs. Whether for good or for bad, in statutes delegating
emergency authority the present trend is pointed toward inclusion
of congressional power to review administrative action by concurrent
resolution.</p>


<h4>DELEGATORY LEGISLATION INCORPORATING POWER
TO CHECK BY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION</h4>

<p>Congress appears to have pursued a variety of objectives in incorporating
within delegatory statutes a power to influence or control administration
through concurrent or simple resolution. (a) In some instances
it has reserved power to terminate a statute or program by
concurrent resolution. (b) It has asserted power to enable or require
executive action by concurrent resolution. (c) Finally, it has made administrative
exercise of delegated power subject to congressional approval
or disapproval by concurrent or simple resolution. The forty
odd delegatory statutes noted in the course of this study, which reserve
to Congress the right to influence or limit administrative action
by simple or concurrent resolution, will be discussed in this order.</p>

<p><em>Terminating Programs</em>: Use of the concurrent resolution for the
express purpose of terminating legislative delegations of power
to the executive branch may take two forms: (a) congressional reservation
of a power to repeal the authorizing statute, or (b) congressional
reservation of the right, by concurrent resolution, to
declare an end to the particular conditions under which the President<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
is empowered to take action. Exercise of congressional power to
repeal by concurrent resolution generally has been expressed as
follows: “The provisions of this Act, ... shall terminate on June 30,
1943, or upon the date of a proclamation by the President, or upon
the date specified in a concurrent resolution ...”<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> A similar provision
is contained in at least twenty-three emergency statutes enacted since
1941 and listed below.<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> The Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949
secured to the Congress a form of item veto through reserving to it
the power by concurrent resolution to terminate assistance to any
nation under the Act.<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a></p>

<p>Instances in which Congress reserves the right by concurrent resolution
to declare terminated the conditions authorizing executive
action are fewer. In a 1941 statute the Secretary of the Navy was
authorized to establish a plant protection force for naval shore
establishments and to maintain and operate this force until June 30,
1943, unless Congress at an earlier date, by concurrent resolution,
declared such force no longer necessary.<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> A 1942 amendment to the
Communications Act of 1934 gave the President certain powers
to control wire communication facilities upon proclamation by the
President that a state or threat of war exists involving the United
States. The President’s powers in this respect were to end not later
than six months after the termination of such state or threat of war
and not later than such earlier date as the Congress by concurrent
resolution may designate.<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> In defining national emergency for purposes
of the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950,<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> Congress stipulated
that “the provisions of this title shall be operative only during the
existence of a state of civil defense emergency.... The existence
of such emergency may be proclaimed by the President or by concurrent
resolution of the Congress if the President in such proclamation,
or the Congress in such resolution, finds that an attack upon the
United States has occurred or is anticipated and that the national
safety therefore requires an invocation of the provisions of this title.”
Congress also has reserved the right, although not on an exclusive
basis, to determine by concurrent resolution the “dates of commencement
and termination of an armed conflict.”<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></p>

<p><em>Enabling or Requiring Executive Action</em>: An example of the use of
the concurrent resolution as an enabling device is the provision of the
Neutrality Act of 1939,<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> which imposed rigorous limitations upon
United States carriage to belligerents “whenever the President, or the
Congress by concurrent resolution, shall find that there exists a state of
war between foreign states.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span></p>

<p><em>The Legislative Veto</em>: The Reorganization Acts of 1939, 1945 and
1949<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> are also illustrations of the use of the simple and concurrent
resolution to effect approval or disapproval of administrative action.
All three Acts were designed to foster reorganization to enable the
government to cope with emergency conditions, and the 1945 Act
had the expressed purpose of facilitating orderly transition from war
to peace.<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> The 1939 Act stipulated that the President’s reorganization
plans were to take effect sixty calendar days after the date on
which the plan was transmitted to the Congress, but only if during
the sixty-day period the two Houses of Congress had not passed
a concurrent resolution stating in substance that the Congress did
not favor the reorganization plan. A similar provision was contained
in the 1945 Act, and on July 15, 1946 Congress, by concurrent resolution,
disapproved the President’s Reorganization Plan No. 1.<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> The
1949 Act provided for a veto of Reorganization Plans by one house.
Under the latter, a reorganization plan becomes operative “upon the
expiration of the first period of sixty calendar days, of continuous
session of the Congress, following the date on which the plan is
transmitted to it; but only if, between the date of transmittal and the
expiration of such sixty-day period there has not been passed by
either of the two Houses, by the affirmative vote of a majority of
the authorized membership of that House, a resolution stating in
substance that the House does not favor the reorganization plan.”<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a></p>

<p>In a class by itself is the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950, by the
terms of which the concurrent resolution may be employed to veto
interstate civil defense compacts.<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> The consent of the Congress
would be granted to each compact, after the termination of sixty
calendar days of continuous session of the Congress from the time Congress
first received notice of the compact. But Congressional consent
could be denied anytime during the sixty day period if Congress
passed a concurrent resolution stating that it did not approve the
compact.</p>

<p>Remaining for consideration is the utilization of the concurrent
resolution to enable Congress to achieve a more intimate participation
in the administration of selected programs, principally in the field
of immigration and naturalization. In the Alien Registration Act
of 1940<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> Congress provided for the deportation of additional classes
of aliens. Aliens of proved good moral character might have deportation
suspended under certain conditions at the discretion of
the Attorney General. However, if deportation were suspended for
more than six months, all of the facts and pertinent provisions of law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
in the case must be reported to the Congress within ten days after the
beginning of its next regular session, with the reasons for such suspension.
If during that session the two Houses pass a concurrent
resolution stating in substance that the Congress does not favor the
suspension of such deportation, the Attorney General is required to
carry out the deportation as provided by law. If, however, during
that session the two Houses fail to pass such a resolution, the Attorney
General is required to cancel deportation proceedings at the end of the
session. In subsequent legislation Congress reserved the right by
concurrent resolution to suspend deportation of aliens or to grant
permanent residence,<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> and a considerable proportion of the concurrent
resolutions enacted each year now constitute directives to
the Attorney General in this regard.<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

<p>The Rubber Producing Facilities Disposal Act of 1953<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> set up a
Rubber Producing Facilities Disposal Commission and authorized
it to enter into contracts for disposal of federally held rubber producing
facilities. The Commission was to report to Congress in considerable
detail on the negotiations and the contents of the contracts.
The report had to be submitted to both Houses of Congress on the
same day. Upon the expiration of sixty days of continuous session
of the Congress following the date upon which the report was submitted
to it, the Commission was free to proceed to carry out the
contracts and proposals as outlined in its report, but only to the
extent that such contracts and proposals had not been disapproved
by either House of Congress by a resolution during the sixty-day
period. Congress in recent years also has asserted the right by concurrent
resolution to “declare ... that the period of active service
required of any age group” under the Universal Military Training
and Service Act “should be decreased ... or ... should be eliminated.”<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>


<h4>USE OF CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
PROVISIONS TO CHECK ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION</h4>

<p>A survey of the statute books from 1939 through 1954 reveals few
instances of congressional employment of the device of the concurrent
resolution so thoughtfully included in delegatory statutes. However,
the <cite>Congressional Record</cite> for the same period bears evidence of repeated
effort on the part of members of the legislature to influence the
administration of delegatory statutes through concurrent or, in some
instances, the simple resolution.</p>

<p><em>Terminating Powers:</em> Legislative efforts to terminate statutes
by concurrent resolution prove anticlimactic in view of the many instances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
in which the power to accomplish this was included in the
delegatory statute. The statute which provoked the most vigorous
and persistent effort at termination by concurrent resolution was that
of January 20, 1942, establishing daylight saving time.<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> From 1943
through 1945 some twenty-four concurrent resolutions were introduced
to terminate the effect of the Daylight Savings Act.<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> None of these
concurrent resolutions survived committee screening.</p>

<p>In 1941 a House concurrent resolution abrogating the authority of
the President to provide aid to Russia under the Lend-Lease Act died
in the Foreign Relations Committee.<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> The appropriate provision of
the Lend-Lease Act provided in general terms for termination of the
lend-lease authority upon adoption of a concurrent resolution by both
Houses.<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> The Act did not provide for suspension by concurrent resolution
of authority to aid specified countries and the resolution
probably sought to exercise a power which Congress had not reserved
to itself in the Act.</p>

<p>Pressure to terminate war controls intensified following the September
2, 1945, signing of the Japanese instrument of surrender. On
September 14, House Concurrent Resolution 84 was introduced, “to
terminate the effectiveness of certain provisions of the Second War
Power Act, 1942.” Section 1501 of the Act provided for termination
of certain of the Titles of the Act by concurrent resolution.<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> The
resolution did not emerge from the Judiciary Committee, to which it
was referred. Another unsuccessful effort was made to invoke the
concurrent resolution provisions of the Act two years later.<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> The year
following termination of hostilities saw a short-lived effort to terminate
by concurrent resolution a statute which did not incorporate provision
to this effect.<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a></p>

<p>Some ten additional concurrent resolutions were introduced in the
two years succeeding 1945, the effect of which would have been formal
termination of the state of hostilities to which the lives of various
statutes had been hinged.<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> None of the resolutions emerged from
committee.</p>

<p><em>Enabling and Requiring Executive Action:</em> Aside from action
on reorganization plans submitted to Congress by the President, the
sole striking instance of successful employment of a concurrent resolution
provision incorporated in a delegatory statute concerned initiation
of a postwar highway construction program, under the Federal-Aid
Highway Act of 1944. The Act, it will be recalled, enabled the
Congress by concurrent resolution to stipulate the date the program
was to go into effect. Senate and House concurrent resolutions were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
introduced in the Seventy-ninth Congress in 1945 fixing the first post-war
fiscal year under the Act as the year ending June 30, 1946.<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> The
House resolution passed in that chamber and was agreed to by the
Senate.<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></p>

<p>The Neutrality Act of 1939 is the outstanding, in fact the only, recent
instance of congressional effort to exercise power by concurrent
resolution to require executive action.<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> The Act drastically curbed
American carriage to and trade with belligerents. The President could
proclaim the existence of war between two nations; or, upon passage
of a concurrent resolution finding that war existed between two countries,
the President must issue a proclamation identifying the belligerents.<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
Thereupon the trade restrictions in the Act become effective
and criminal penalty attaches to their violation.</p>

<p>On the theory that Section 1 (a) “places on this Congress a responsibility
corresponding with that which has been placed on the President
in the matter of finding a condition of war to exist,”<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> individual members
introduced concurrent resolutions declaring the existence of war
between the U.S.S.R. and Finland,<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> Japan and China,<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> and Germany
and the U.S.S.R.<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> These were decently interred in committee.</p>

<p><em>The Legislative Veto:</em> Although the first Reorganization Act
containing provision for legislative veto of reorganization plans was
enacted in 1939, concurrent resolutions disapproving such plans were
introduced in vain until 1946. In July of that year both houses agreed
to House Concurrent Resolution 155 disapproving President Truman’s
Reorganization Plan No. 1.<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a> The next May a new Congress disapproved
Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1947.<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> The third and last reorganization
plan to be defeated by concurrent resolution was Plan No.
1, 1948, which incurred congressional disapproved in March of that
year.<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> The Reorganization Act of 1949 permitted veto of the President’s
plans by simple resolution of one house.<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> President Truman’s
efforts to elevate the Federal Security Agency to departmental status
were frustrated by Senate Resolution 147 of 1949, which was adopted
by that body on August 16, 1949.<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> All of the veto resolutions passed
by Congress were favorably reported from committee to the house
of origin.</p>

<p>During the period studied three veto resolutions died in committee,<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>
three (all favorably reported from committee) passed the House of
Representatives only to be rejected by the Senate,<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> and four were
adversely reported from committee and defeated in the chamber in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
which they originated.<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> Only one veto resolution was discharged from
committee. It subsequently passed the House but failed in the
Senate.<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Conclusion</span></h3>

<p>In an era in which governmental controls invade every sphere of
human activity, from economic to cultural and political, administrative
responsibility is essential to the maintenance of the democratic
system. Administration which is responsible is lacking in the elements
of bad faith, arbitrariness, or capriciousness. It constitutes a reasoned
effort, in good faith, to approximate the legislative intent.</p>

<p>Congress is one important source of oversight of administration. Its
effectiveness in performing this role is a function of (a) the adequacy
of its tools, and the skill, conscience, and sustained interest of the
members in wielding them, and (b) the standards it applies in measuring
the adequacy of administrative action.</p>

<p>Experience in this area indicates that Congress is more imaginative
in fashioning tools for checking and influencing the administration of
delegated powers than it is skillful and determined in employing them
to hold administrators to clearly defined standards of performance.</p>

<p>The national legislature has attempted to employ reporting devices
and the concurrent resolution to influence, enable or require executive
action, to terminate or suspend the conditions authorizing it, or to restrict
the application of programs to specified groups. Not infrequently
it has made the exercise of delegated powers contingent upon prior
congressional approval or disapproval.</p>

<p>With the exception of the last category, however, Congress has not
effectively wielded the tool it engineered. The veto resolution has
received ample use because the executive automatically initiates congressional
review when it invokes the delegated power which is subject
to veto. Where Congress must initiate review, the concurrent resolution
provisions tend to lie dormant, or congressional action tends to
be directed at vindicating sectional interests (revocation of daylight
saving time), or direct participation in the framing of administrative
decisions, case by case (deportation suspensions).</p>

<p>Perhaps the moral of the story is that we must free congressmen
from constituency loyalties and subject them to strict party discipline
if we wish to insure that available techniques for the legislative control
of administration are effectively employed to serve an interest
which is broad and public.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter IX</span>
<br><span class="cheaderfont">INTER-AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The study of administration proceeds within the framework of a
taxonomy of human relationships, the breadth and content of which
remain fluid. In large measure, when we speak of law we refer to a
socially prescribed and sanctioned taxonomy of human relations.
The analysis offered in this chapter is grounded upon the premise that
clarification and refinement of a taxonomy of administrative relationships
may result from the study of legislative enactments
prescribing relationships between administrative agencies. It also
reflects the supposition that at a time when the behavioral or human-relations
approach to the study of administration is in ascendancy,
such a review may provide an essential foundation for the contrasting
of formality and actuality which is one of the characteristics of
behaviorism.</p>

<p>In the following pages we record and classify various kinds of
inter-agency relationship prescribed by statute. We have attempted
to employ the inductive approach, permitting the categories and
gradations of relationship to emerge from the materials. But we
are not unaware of the inevitable intermixture of the <i lang="la">a priori</i>.</p>

<p>When fashioning economic regulatory legislation, Congress must
heed the complexity of the industrial society to which the controls
are to be applied, and of the bureaucracy through which regulation
is to be accomplished. It will be possible to realize the legislative
purpose only if the active co-operation and help of a wide variety
of official agencies and private groups can be enlisted. And these must
include the groups to be regulated.<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a></p>

<p>Thus it is not surprising to find, upon examining a large number
of emergency regulatory statutes enacted during the last twenty-five
years, that they contain many provisions detailing the relationships
which should prevail between the administering agencies and other
groups, official, semiofficial, or private. Such provisions establish a
variety of rights and obligations. They may have the effect of enlarging
or constricting the discretion of a particular agency to interpret
and pursue legislative policy goals. In the pages which follow we
attempt to sort out and categorize such provisions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span></p>

<p>The confusing medley of statutory provisions for kinds and gradations
of inter-agency relationship is perhaps best reduced to order
by invoking the image of three overlapping spheres.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" style="max-width: 40.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_111.jpg" alt="Inter-agency relationships.">
  <figcaption class="caption">

<p class="center">Permissive or mandatory solicitation or receipt or advice of a nonbinding nature<br>

Mandatory performance in accordance with instruction of another agency<br>

Joint pursuit of policy goals by co-ordinate agencies</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The center sphere, into which and from which the others spill,
represents the kind of inter-agency relationship in which one agency
performs a mandatory, nondiscretionary function at the direction or
“request” of another. Flowing into it, from the left, is the sphere
in which agencies are permitted or compelled to receive advice from,
to consult or confer with others, but are under no obligation to follow
the advice received. The third sphere is that in which two or more
co-ordinate agencies share active responsibility and authority for
the pursuit of a common policy goal.</p>

<p>If the interagency relationships provided for by statute are scaled
according to the binding quality of the advice received by one agency
from another or according to the degree to which two or more agencies
share authority and responsibility for program administration subtle
nuances of interagency relationship are revealed. Advice received
may be purely of an informative and nonbinding nature, or the
statute may be so worded as to indicate that “advice” from one
agency to another amounts virtually to direction. In the sharing
of program authority and responsibility, one agency may perform
ministerial functions at the direction or “request” of another, or,
at the opposite extreme, interagency personnel, judgment, and resources
may be fused toward the accomplishment of a common goal.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Communication</span></h3>

<p>Herbert A. Simon’s definition of communication “as any process
whereby decisional premises are transmitted from one member of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
an organization to another,”<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> generally describes the kinds of legislative
provisions which will be reviewed in this section, with the exception
that we are here concerned with the transmission of decisional premises
from one agency to another. The transmission may be permissive
or mandatory. The information or advice conveyed may or may not
be related to the framing of a particular decision; it may or may not
be binding upon the recipient agency.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Communication Unrelated to the
Framing of a Particular Decision</span></h3>

<p><em>Permissive Consultation</em>: Provisions for communication are perhaps
seen in their mildest form in the Foreign Agents Registration
Act of 1938, which established the right, although clearly not the
duty, of the Secretary of the Treasury and the Postmaster General
to accede to the request of the Librarian of Congress that they provide
the librarian with copies of foreign printed matter excluded from the
United States under congressional statutes.<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a></p>

<p><em>Must Receive Advice</em>: The 1938 Naval Reserve Act created a
Naval Reserve Policy Board, at least half the members of which were
to be naval reserve officers called to Board duty from inactive duty
status, which was to be convened annually for the purpose of advising
the Secretary of the Navy on the formulation of Naval Reserve
Policies.<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> Here a definite obligation to communicate, and a special
agency for communication are established, and the Secretary of the
Navy is by inference required to receive proffered advice, although
he is not obligated to act in conformance with it.</p>

<p><em>Must Confer or Consult</em>: Dictionaries tend to regard the words
“advice” and “consult” as synonyms. And it may be that the Congress
tends to employ these terms interchangeably. Yet it is reasonable
to suppose that the legislature does not regard the transmission of
decisional premises as an invariable one-way process. If this be true,
it is possible although not demonstrable that “advise” as employed
in statutes connotes the offering of counsel or opinion, recommending
as wise or prudent—the communications process flowing in one
direction; and “consult” implies a two-way communication process,
“talking over a situation or a subject with someone to decide points
in doubt.”<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p>

<p>The Emergency Railroad Transportation Act of 1933 is infused
with a quality of briskness which is absent from the statutes alluded
to above. In this Act Congress created a co-ordinator of transportation
and a number of regional railroad co-ordinating committees. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
stipulated that the co-ordinator must “confer freely with the committees,
and the committees, the carriers, the subsidiaries, and the
Interstate Commerce Commission shall furnish him ... such information
and reports as he may desire.”<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></p>

<p>The Defense Production Act of 1950 required the President, in
exercising the price and wage stabilization provisions of the Act, “so
far as practicable, (to) advise and consult with, and establish and
utilize the committees of, representatives of persons substantially
affected by regulations or orders issued hereunder.”<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a></p>

<p><em>Must Consider</em>: While not saying that proffered advice must be
accepted, Congress indicated in a 1946 statute that the Civil Aeronautics
Administrator was to hold himself open to influence. In
drawing up his plan for the development of public airports in the
United States, he was required as far as possible to consult and give
consideration to the views and recommendations of the Civil Aeronautics
Board, the States, the Territories, Puerto Rico, and their
political subdivisions.<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> He also had to consult and consider to the
extent feasible the views and recommendations of the Federal Communications
Commission.</p>

<p>The Philippine War Damage Commission was created in 1946 and
assigned the task of making compensation for war damage to private
property in the Philippines. The Commission was required so far as
practicable to give consideration to the recommendations of the
Filipino Rehabilitation Commission created in an earlier act. But,
said Congress, the Commission was not required to await, or be bound
by such recommendations.<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Communication Related to Framing of a Particular Decision</span></h3>

<p>The foregoing advice and consultation provisions fall short of
setting the requirement in a specific action context. They seem to
have the objective of maximizing the likelihood that interested official
and private groups will have the opportunity to influence program
content. At the same time they imply or categorically state that the
action agency need not be guided by such advice. It is not patently
clear in any instance that the administrator must defer action until
after consultation; and, of course, in one instance he is specifically
advised that he is free of such a requirement.</p>

<p>The statutes referred to below clearly link the prescribed advice or
consultation to the taking of specified action by the administrator.
In some instances he must advise with others prior to taking action,
but is not required to follow the advice. In others he is enabled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
but not required to act upon receipt of a report or information from
another agency. An occasional statute will require not only consultation,
but the making of specific findings precedent to exercising powers
delegated by Congress. The administrator will sometimes find himself
in a position in which he may take certain action only if it is
acceptable to, or meets the approval of, other groups. And, carrying
us to the end of this progression, we have the statutory requirement
that the administrator act in conformance with advice received.</p>

<p><em>Must Seek Advice Prior to Acting</em>: A June, 1934 amendment to
the Tariff Act of 1930 sought to assist recovery from “the present
emergency in restoring the American standard of living” by authorizing
the President to enter into reciprocal trade agreements for the
relaxation of duties and import restrictions.<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> Prior to concluding
individual agreements, however, the President had to seek information
and advice with respect thereto from the United States Tariff Commission,
the Departments of State, Agriculture, and Commerce and
from such other sources as he deemed appropriate. The advice need
not be followed, but it must be sought precedent to concluding a
reciprocal trade agreement. The 1934 grant of power to the President
to prohibit the sale of arms to participants in the Chaco War made the
exercise of that power contingent upon prior consultation with
governments of other American Republics.<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></p>

<p>Similarly, in granting the President power, in March, 1941 to
authorize the transfer of American military equipment to the government
of any country whose defense the President considered vital to
the defense of the United States, Congress specified that no defense
article not manufactured for such a foreign power might be disposed of
except after consultation with the Chief of Staff of the Army or the
Chief of Naval Operations of the Navy, or both.<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> The War Risk
Insurance Act of 1950 permitted the Secretary of Commerce “with
the approval of the President, and after such consultation with interested
agencies of the Government as the President may require,”
to “provide insurance and reinsurance against loss or damage” of
American merchant vessels “by war risks.”<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> In 1950 security provisions
were added to the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938. Among these
was an authorization for the Secretary of Commerce to establish zones
or areas in the airspace above the United States as he found necessary
in the interests of national security. Having established such spaces,
he might, “after consultation with the Department of Defense and
the Civil Aeronautics Board ... prohibit or restrict flights of aircraft”
within them.<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span></p>

<p>These statutes simply open up the channels of communication and
insist that they be used prior to the taking of action. They do not
explicitly require the administrator to accept proffered advice, and
whatever effect they have upon his freedom of discretion is subtle
and impalpable.</p>

<p><em>May Act on Receipt of Advice or Request</em>: The 1937 statute
extending the life of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation permitted
the Board of Directors of the Corporation to report to the
President that private credit was sufficiently available from private
sources to meet legitimate demands of any class of eligible borrowers,
whereupon the President might authorize the directors to suspend
lending to that class.<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> Here, in effect, the Board of Directors of the
RFC was given power to report (recommend) and thereby enable
presidential action. The 1947 surplus property act authorized the
disposal agency, upon the request of the Administrator of Civil Aeronautics,
the Secretary of War, or the Secretary of the Navy to omit
any of the terms, or conditions for the transfer of title to such property.<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>
The agency granted a dispensing power which it was enabled
to exercise upon receipt of a request from specified officials.</p>

<p>The first of these two statutes enabled the President to act after
the RFC had made what amounted to a finding. In this, it is similar
to the Nationality Act of 1940, which provided that the President
might, in his discretion, exempt certain aliens in the United States
from the classification of alien enemy, provided the Department of
Justice investigated and established the loyalty of the alien.<a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> A
Department of Justice finding of loyalty enables but does not compel
the President to act.</p>

<p>The Secretary of War was granted power in 1941 to remove any
officer from the active list of the Regular Army for such causes and
under such regulations as he might prescribe. He could not exercise
this power in individual cases, however, until the officer had been
recommended for removal by a board of not less than five general
officers convened for this purpose by the Secretary of War.<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></p>

<p><em>Action on Making an Independent Finding</em>: At least two of the
statutes covered in this survey required the President not only to
consult, or to receive recommendations prior to taking action, but
in addition, to make an explicit finding of fact. The India Emergency
Food Aid Act of 1951 permitted the President, after consultation
with appropriate Government officials and representatives of
private shipping, and after finding and proclaiming that private shipping
was not available on reasonable terms and conditions for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
transportation of supplies made available under Act, to provide for
carriage in government-owned ships.<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> Four days after signing
the Act, the President proclaimed that he had consulted with public
officials and private shipping representatives, and had found it necessary
to use government ships.<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> The 1951 amendments to the Universal
Military Training and Service Act authorized the President “upon
finding by him that such action is justified by the strength of the
Armed Forces in the light of international conditions,” and “upon
recommendation of the Secretary of Defense” to decrease or eliminate
periods of compulsory military service.<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a></p>

<p>The remaining statutes, in varying degree, subject administrative
decision-making to external controls.</p>

<p><em>Action if Acceptable to Others</em>: Congress in 1935 imposed, for three
years, limitations upon imports of Philippine yams, twines, cables,
and other fibers. The limitation was subject to continuance for an
additional three years by presidential proclamation, provided such
extension was acceptable to the President of the Commonwealth.<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>
Such an extension was made by a proclamation of January, 1938,
in which the President recited that “the President of the Commonwealth
of the Philippines has indicated to me ... his acceptance of
an extension of the operation of that Act for an additional period of
three years.”<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> Unlike the earlier statutes which require consultation
prior to action, or sometimes permit action only following recommendation
and findings, here the substance of the President’s action is
subject to approval from a source external to the presidency.</p>

<p><em>Action Upon Receipt of Prior Approval</em>: We have already employed,
in another context, the provision of the War Risk Insurance
Act of 1950, which hinged action by the Secretary of Commerce to
the prior approval of the President.<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> The Defense Production Act
of 1950 exempted from anti-trust prosecution business agreements
made pursuant to the request of the President. The President was
given a limited authority to delegate this power to subordinate
officials, but only upon the condition that such officials consult with
the Attorney General and with the Chairman of the Federal Trade
Commission not less than ten days before making any request or
finding thereunder. In addition, the request was to be subject to the
prior approval of the Attorney General.<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> In August, 1950, Congress
legislated on the matter of termination of government employment
for security reasons. Persons whose employment was thus terminated
might be employed elsewhere in the government only if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Civil Service Commission approved a request coming from the individual
or the prospective employing agency.<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a></p>

<p>The Rubber Producing Facilities Disposal Commission was directed
to “consult and advise with the Attorney General” concerning the
disposal of such facilities. The 1953 statute creating the Commission
required that its report to Congress, suggesting an appropriate manner
of disposing of government-owned producing facilities, be submitted
first to the Attorney General who would advise the Commission
“whether, in his opinion, the proposed disposition would violate the
anti-trust laws.” His findings approving the proposed disposals were
to be appended to the report which the Commission made to Congress.
Thus, in effect, the Commission was gently admonished to bring in a
report bearing the Attorney General’s approval.<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<p><em>Must Act in Conformance With Request</em>: The next group of statutes
compel the administrator to accept and to act in accordance
with recommendations or requests coming from a source beyond his
agency. The Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938, as amended
in 1942, permitted certain exemptions from its registration provisions.
The Attorney General might, after notice to the employing
government or the person concerned, and with the approval of the
Secretary of State, terminate in whole or in part an exemption from
registration granted to United States residents who were employees
of a foreign government. When the Secretary of State initiated a
request for termination of an exemption, the Attorney General had
to comply with the request.<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> The Second War Powers Act of 1942
contained a provision for the waiving of navigation and inspection
laws under certain conditions. The head of each department or
agency responsible for the administration of the navigation and
vessel inspection laws was directed to waive compliance of such
laws upon the request of the Secretary of the Navy or the Secretary
of War to the extent believed necessary in the conduct of the war by
the officer making the request.<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a></p>

<p>The discretion of federal jurists has to some extent been subjected
to constriction by the executive. The Secretary of the Navy was
given power, in a July, 1944, statute, to certify to federal courts that
pending suits arising out of damage caused by naval vessels or towage
or salvage services to naval vessels would, if tried, tend to endanger
the security of naval operations. Upon receiving such a certification,
the federal court having jurisdiction in the case was required to stay
further proceedings until six months after the cessation of hostilities
or such earlier date as the Secretary of the Navy might set.<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span></p>

<p>Congress, in February, 1952, took emergency action temporarily
suspending the import duty on lead. The Tariff Commission was to
advise the President at the end of any month in which the average
market price of lead delivered at New York had fallen below eighteen
cents per pound, “and the President shall, by proclamation, not later
than twenty days after he has been so advised by the Tariff Commission,
revoke such suspension of the duties.”<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> In June, 1952, the
President issued a proclamation under this Act, revoking the suspension
of the duty.<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p>

<p>The converse of these arrangements whereby an administrator is
compelled to take prescribed action upon the request, or upon a
finding of others, is the situation in which he may be barred from
taking contemplated action, in consequence of a request or finding
coming from another agency. Our final illustration falls into this
bracket. The President was permitted by the Export Control Act
of 1949 to “prohibit or curtail the exportation from the United States
... of any articles, materials, or supplies, including technical data.”
But he could not exercise this power “with respect to any agricultural
commodity, including fats and oils, during any period for which the
supply of such commodity is determined by the Secretary of Agriculture
to be in excess of the requirements of the domestic economy.”<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Integrative Relationships</span></h3>

<p>The statutory provisions enumerated above have the apparent
objective of facilitating communication between agencies or introducing
checks and balances—contrived frustrations—into the administrative
process. At the least intense end of the scale is permissive
interagency communication; gradually the relating of interagency
communication and agency action intensifies until the point is reached
at which an agency may exercise a delegated power only upon clearance
with another agency, or is compelled to exercise it upon the
direction of another. However, the relationship between agencies is
communicative, and they do not by statute have joint responsibility
for decision-making or day-to-day program development and
execution.</p>

<p>The broad group of statutes to which we now turn attempts to
distribute among a number of agencies responsibility and authority
for joint decision-making and action. The resources and judgment
of many agencies may be focused on one program, or a system may
be set up for co-ordinating the activities of many agencies toward the
attainment of broad policy goals. The kind of interagency relationship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
contemplated by Congress appears to be more active and
positive, more a harnessing of equals, than those which we have <a id="Ref_119" href="#BRef_119">thus
far reviewed.</a><a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></p>

<p>Four principal categories of statutory provisions may be distinguished
under this general head. Some aim at joint decision-making by
two or more agencies. Others enjoin agencies to “co-operate” in the
administration of a given program. A third group establishes
mutual assistance arrangements among agencies. Finally, we have
those statutory provisions which seek co-ordination of interagency
activities.<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a></p>


<h4>JOINT DECISION-MAKING</h4>

<p>A 1939 stockpiling act required the Secretary of War, the Secretary
of the Navy, and the Secretary of the Interior, to determine whether
certain materials purchased under the Act were strategic and critical.
Once this determination was made, they then were permitted to
determine the quality and quantities of materials to be purchased
under the Act.<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> The Secretary of War and the Secretary of the
Navy, when they considered such action appropriate because the
domestic production or supply of certain materials was insufficient to
meet the industrial, military, and naval needs of the country, were
to direct the Secretary of the Treasury, through the medium of the
Procurement Division of his Department to make purchases in
accordance with specifications prepared by the Procurement Division
of the Treasury Department and approved by the Secretary of War
and the Secretary of the Navy. Two months later Congress authorized
the Commodity Credit Corporation to accept such strategic
and critical materials in exchange for such surplus agricultural commodities;
and for the purpose of such exchange it was left to the three
Secretaries to determine which materials are strategic and critical
and the quantity and quality of such materials needed.<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a></p>

<p>The Central Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 set up procedures
for granting asylum to foreign nationals who have performed valuable
security services for the United States. Whenever the Director of
the CIA, the Attorney General, and the Commissioner of Immigration
determines that the entry of a particular alien for permanent residence
is in the interest of national security or essential to the furtherance
of the national intelligence mission, such alien and his immediate
family shall be given entry into the United States for permanent
residence without regard to their inadmissibility under the immigration
or any other laws and regulations, or to the failure to comply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
with such laws and regulations pertaining to admissibility.<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> The
Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 assigns to the Secretary of
State, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Attorney General jointly
the function of determining the annual quota of immigrants for any
quota area.<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> On June 30, 1952, the President issued a proclamation
reciting that the quotas had been determined, and listing them.<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a></p>

<p>The National Security Act of 1947 recited as one of its purposes
the establishment of integrated policies and procedures for the departments,
agencies, and functions of the Government relating to
the national security.<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a></p>


<h4>CO-OPERATION</h4>

<p>Joint decision-making shades into co-operative relationships which,
if loose and flexible, may be continuing and steady. Such relations
may exist with private as well as official groups.</p>

<p><em>Must Co-operate</em>: The Small Business Concerns Mobilization Act
made it the duty of the Chairman of the War Production Board to
co-operate to the fullest practicable extent with the Director of
Civilian Supply and other appropriate governmental agencies in the
issuance of all orders limiting production by business enterprises with
a view to insuring that small business concerns would not be bypassed
in the production of war materials and goods essential to the civilian
population.</p>

<p>In granting the Secretary of the Interior power to construct demonstration
plants for production of synthetic and liquid fuels from
coal oil shale, and agricultural and forestry products, the Congress
specified that “any activities under this Act relating to the production
of liquid fuels from agricultural and forestry products should be
carried out in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture and
subject to the direction of the Secretary of Agriculture.”<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> A 1945
flood-control act clearly sought to effect interagency co-operation in
facilitating the replacement by farmers of flood-damaged or -destroyed
<a id="Ref_120" href="#BRef_120">farm equipment.</a><a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> The War Production Board, and every other
governmental agency which had jurisdiction over allocations and
priorities relating to farm machinery and equipment were authorized
and directed immediately to take whatever steps were necessary to
provide for the necessary allocations and priorities to enable farmers
in the areas affected by floods in 1944 and 1945 to replace and repair
their farm machinery and equipment which was destroyed or
damaged by such floods, or windstorms, or fire caused by lightning,
and to continue farm operations.<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span></p>

<p>The Defense Production Act of 1950 provided that whenever the
price and wage stabilization powers contained in the Act were exercised,
all agencies of the Government dealing with price and wage
stabilization, within the limits of their authority and jurisdiction,
should co-operate in carrying out the purposes of the Act.<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

<p><em>May Co-operate</em>: The Emergency Price Control Act of 1942 was in
part designed “to permit voluntary co-operation between the Government
and producers, processors, and others to accomplish the ...
purposes” of stabilizing prices and preventing speculation.<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> “It
shall be the policy of those departments and agencies of the Government
dealing with wages (including the Department of Labor and
its various bureaus, the War Department, the Navy Department,
the War Production Board, the National Labor Relations Board, the
National Mediation Board, the National War Labor Board, and
others heretofore or hereafter created), within the limits of their
authority and jurisdiction, to work toward a stabilization of prices,
fair and equitable wages, and cost of production.”<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a></p>


<h4>MUTUAL ASSISTANCE</h4>

<p>Congress will not infrequently require or enable one agency, on an
interim or continuing basis, to come to the assistance of another in
the execution of its program. This may take the form of providing
money, material, facilities, or service to the agency. It is a kind of
mutual assistance program within the executive branch.</p>

<p>The Reconstruction Finance Corporation, for example, was occasionally
treated by Congress as a source of credit to enable agencies
to launch authorized programs immediately after enactment, and
thus avoid the delays which attend appropriation of funds for authorized
programs. The Far Eastern Economic Assistance Act of 1950
authorized the appropriation to the President of sixty million dollars
to enable the Economic Co-operation Administration to furnish
assistance to the Republic of Korea. As a way of getting the program
started at once, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation was
authorized and directed to make advances not to exceed thirty million
dollars in the aggregate, until the regular appropriation was available.<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>
It can readily be seen that this device might be employed not only
to avoid the normal delays of the appropriations process, but to
circumvent or nullify the obstructive tactics of an unfriendly appropriations
subcommittee.</p>

<p>The India Emergency Food Aid Act of 1951 contained a similar
provision. If the President, after consultation with public and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
private shipping officials, found that private shipping was not available
to carry American food to India on reasonable terms and conditions,
the Reconstruction Finance Corporation was authorized and
directed to make advances not to exceed in the aggregate twenty
million dollars to the Department of Commerce for activation of
vessels for such transportation.<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a></p>

<p>Other mutual assistance provisions enable or require agencies
to produce or procure goods or services for other agencies under
certain conditions. The Tennessee Valley Authority Act required
the Corporation, upon the requisition of the Secretary of War or the
Secretary of the Navy to manufacture for and sell at cost to the
United States explosives or their nitrogenous content. Upon the
requisition of the Secretary of War the Corporation was to allot and
deliver without charge to the War Department whatever power was
necessary in the judgment of the Department for use in operation
of all locks, lifts, and other facilities in aid of navigation.<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> The
Helium Gas Act of 1937 permitted the Army, Navy, and other government
agencies to requisition helium from the Bureau of Mines, which
agency was charged with responsibility for the production of helium.<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<p>The Maritime Commission was assigned responsibility, in July, 1941,
for meeting the shipping needs of defense agencies.<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> The Secretary of
the Air Force was directed to make available to the Civil Air Patrol
by gift or by loan, sale or otherwise, with or without charge, obsolete
or surplus aircraft and aircraft parts to permit utilization of facilities
of the Air Force, and to furnish to Civil Air Patrol the fuel needed
to enable it to complete any specifically assigned mission.<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a></p>


<h4>CO-ORDINATION</h4>

<p>If co-operation involves working together, co-ordination is the
process whereby things are placed in position relative to each other
and to the system of which they form parts. Administrators may work
together, or co-operate, toward the end of co-ordinating their programs.
But joint decision-making, or co-operative programming are vitally,
if subtly, different from the co-ordination of programs. In the first
place, joint decision-making or co-operation have the purpose of
focusing the judgment and resources of many agencies upon the
execution of one program, whereas co-ordination involves the relating
of many similar, or possibly diverse, programs. Secondly, to indulge
a tautology, joint-decision-making and co-operation (as provided
for in the statutes just reviewed) involve a positive, creative elaboration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
and execution of programs, whereas co-ordination consists of
minimizing conflict of purpose among two or more programs.</p>

<p>The Commissioners of the District of Columbia were authorized
in August, 1950, to set up an Office of Civil Defense for the District,
which office would, among other things, plan for integration of the
District’s civil defense effort with that of the federal government and
nearby states, and co-operate with governmental and nongovernmental
agencies and co-ordinate the activities within the district.<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>
The National Science Foundation’s functions include that of correlating
its scientific research programs with those undertaken by individuals
and by public and private research groups.<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> The Immigration
and Nationality Act of 1952 authorized the Commissioner of Immigration
and the administrator of the Bureau of Security and Consular
Affairs of the Department of State to maintain direct and continuous
liaison with the Directors of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
and the Central Intelligence Agency and with other internal security
officers of the Government for the purpose of obtaining and exchanging
information for use in enforcing the provisions of this Act in the
interest of the internal security of the United States. The Commissioner
and the administrator are to maintain direct and continuous
liaison with each other with a view to a co-ordinated, uniform, and
efficient administration of this law, and all other immigration and
nationality laws.<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a></p>

<p>There were some statutes with regard to which it is difficult, if not
impossible, upon the basis of reading alone, to determine whether the
purpose was to bring the facilities of many agencies to bear upon the
administration of one program, or to enhance the prospect that the
program would be administered in a manner consistent with the
objectives of other related programs. A study of the legislative
history and the administration of these provisions would probably
disclose that the legislative intent was mixed, or that in the process
of administration both objectives were joined.</p>

<p>We might include within this category the Neutrality Act of 1935
which set up the National Munitions Control Board, to be composed
of the Secretaries of State, Treasury, War, and Navy. The Board,
acting largely through the Secretary of State, was the agency for
execution of the neutrality program.<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> The Contract Settlement Act
of 1944 set up an Office of Contract Settlement, headed by a Director,
and a Contract Settlement Advisory Board, with which the Director
was required to advise and consult. The Board was composed of the
Director, the Secretaries of War, Navy, and Treasury, the Chairman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
of the Maritime Commission, the Administrator of the Foreign
Economic Administration, the Chairman of the Board of Directors
of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the Chairman of the War
Production Board, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the
Smaller War Plants Corporation, and the Attorney General.<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> Any of
these officials might appoint representatives.</p>

<p>The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 contained provision for a Military
Liaison Committee.<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics,
created to supervise the scientific study of the problems of
flight, under a 1948 statute, was to be composed of not more than
seventeen members appointed by the President including two representatives
of the Department of the Air Force; two of the Department
of the Navy, from the office in charge of naval aeronautics,
two of the Civil Aeronautics Authority; one of the Smithsonian
Institute; one of the United States Weather Bureau; one of the
National Bureau of Standards; the Chairman of the Research and
Development Board of the National Military Establishment; and
others.<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a></p>

<p>Are these representative of congressional efforts to organize co-operation,
or to organize co-ordination? We think the latter, although
it is clear that reasonable men could differ, and a careful legislative
history might prove us wrong.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Conclusions</span></h3>

<p>Our findings appear to suggest that either Congress has a considerable
feeling for the subtle nuances of administrative interrelationships,
or that it is loose and inconsistent in the language it employs. The
statutory provisions run a gamut, permitting the exchange of information,
providing formally prescribed sources of advice, compelling
agencies to consult, to consult and consider, to consult prior to taking
specific action, hinging action to the receipt of a prior enabling report
or request, requiring prior consultation and fact finding, requiring
clearance or approval from a source external to the agency, and
finally, compelling action in conformance with the request of another
agency. It has harnessed the judgment and resources of many agencies
to the making of particular kinds of decisions, it has provided for
interagency co-operation and assistance in the accomplishment of
policy goals; and it has taken care to assure co-ordination of related
programs.</p>

<p>These are the relationships which Congress has sought to establish
among administrative agencies.</p>

<br><span class="cheaderfont">JUDICIAL REVIEW</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Edward S. Corwin has appraised as a misfortune the fact that “Constitutionalism
has worked in this country to impress upon the discussion
of public measures a legalistic—not to say theological—mold,”
and has substituted “for the question of the beneficial <em>use</em> of the powers
of government ... the question of their existence.”<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a></p>

<p>The United States Supreme Court, rather than the judicial system,
is popularly conceived to have a distinctive role to play in checking
arbitrary government in time of emergency;<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> and it endeavors to
perform that role, albeit none too successfully at times by ruling on
the constitutionality of the government power asserted during such
period of crisis. However, as the chief appellate body in a judicial
system which as a whole “handles a mere trickle of the great issues
arising”<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> during an emergency, the Supreme Court cannot reasonably
be expected to formulate a coherent theory of democratic response
to emergency whereby action designed to meet the exigencies of war
can be harmonized with our constitutional system with only minimum
risk to the preservation thereof.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Supreme Court’s Approach</span></h3>

<p>In its effort to avoid the Scylla of judicial refusal to review the
constitutionality of legislative or executive emergency action, and
the Charybdis of declaring unconstitutional emergency action which
might be vital to national survival,<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>—i.e., in its efforts to “reconcile the
irreconcilables” which Cardozo considered the essence of the
judicial function—the Supreme Court has traveled various routes.
The majority opinions of the Court, or the concurring or dissenting
opinions of individual justices, have at times asserted that (a) the
Constitution is a rigorously confining document to be inflexibly applied
by the Court in measuring governmental action in war and peace; (b)
there exists an emergency power which is above constitutional limitations;
(c) the Constitution is a flexible charter permitting government
action commensurate with need as measured by the Court.</p>

<p>All three of these approaches are characterized by a preoccupation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
with the question of the existence of the asserted emergency
power. Under the first, the Court is guided by a narrow interpretation
of the quantum of constitutional emergency power and
appears disposed to appraise the validity of asserted authority independently
of any consideration of the indispensability of the power
exercised for successful resolution of the crisis. Involving covertly
virtual acceptance of the principle, <i lang="la">inter arma selent legis</i>, the second
is extremely dangerous; for if applied extensively, it would erode
constitutional balance and restraint and perhaps terminate responsible
government in time of peril. Insofar as it chooses to be guided by the
third and purports to sanction only that which it concedes to be
essential for combating an emergency, the Court not only assumes
a task for which it is ill-suited but also frequently shirks its responsibilities
in the performance thereof. Too often when it dares to condemn
as ultra vires action believed unavoidable in the prosecution
of a war, it postpones its invalidation until after hostilities have
terminated. Such post mortem judicial observations afford most
inadequate guides for ascertaining what will be constitutionally
permissible in time of crisis.</p>

<p>Apart from a few brief illustrations of the aforementioned judicial
approaches, we have placed major emphasis upon the Steel Seizure
Case [Youngstown v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952)], for in that decision
are to be found signally important indications of the most effective
contribution which the Federal judiciary hereafter may make in sustaining
responsible government. The need for a more extensive
review of the Supreme Court’s appraisal of emergency power has
been dispelled by Clinton Rossiter’s study of <cite>The Supreme Court and
the Commander-in-Chief</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a></p>

<p><em>The Constitution as a Rigidly Restrictive Document</em>: In one of the
extremely rare instances in which a Supreme Court Justice has defied
the Chief Executive engaged in prosecuting a war, Chief Justice Roger
B. Taney in 1861, presiding as Circuit Court Judge at Baltimore, demanded
that the military produce in court one John Merryman, who
had been arrested. When Merryman’s jailers replied to Taney that by
virtue of the President’s proclamation suspending the writ of habeas
corpus, they had been directed not to respond to the writ, the venerable
Chief Justice wrote a stinging opinion informing the President that the
power to suspend the writ belonged to Congress alone and could not be
exercised by the chief executive. Notwithstanding his ruling, Merryman
was not released and the President continued his suspension of the
writ, although Congress did not validate his action until 1863.<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps a better example of Taney’s attitude toward the relaxing
of constitutional restraints in wartime is to be found in an earlier,
unpublished opinion, quoted by Swisher in his biography of the Chief
Justice:</p>

<p>“A civil war or any other war does not enlarge the powers of the
federal government over the states or the people beyond what the
compact has given to it in time of war. A state of war does not annul
the 10th article of the amendments to the Constitution, which declares
that ‘the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution,
nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states
respectively or to the people.’</p>

<p>“Nor does a civil war or any other war absolve the judicial department
from the duty of maintaining with an even and firm hand the
rights and powers of the federal government, and of the states, and of
the citizens, as they are written in the Constitution, which every judge
is sworn to support.”<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a></p>

<p>For the other expressions of this absolutist view, we must look to
opinions handed down in the immediate postwar periods of 1866 and
1946. <i lang="fr">Ex parte Milligan</i><a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> involved the incarceration of a northerner
suspected of Southern sympathies. Could such an individual be tried,
convicted and sentenced to death by a military tribunal, in an area far
behind the Northern lines, in fact, in a State which had never been
invaded by the Southern armies? Scores of such instances of military
trial and conviction of civilians had occurred in Northern states untouched
by the war.</p>

<p>The majority opinion for the Supreme Court disposing of this issue
was written by Justice Davis and constitutes as rigid a definition
of the limits circumscribing the war powers as could possibly be stated:</p>

<p>“The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people,
equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection
all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances.
No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented
by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended
during any of the great exigencies of government. Such a doctrine
leads directly to anarchy or despotism; but the theory of necessity
on which it is based is false; for the government, within the constitution,
has all the powers granted to it, which are necessary to preserve
its existence....</p>

<p>“... It could well be said that a country, preserved at the sacrifice
of all the cardinal principles of liberty, is not worth the cost of preservation.”<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span></p>

<p>This opinion by a Lincoln appointee to the Court was offset in part
by the concurring opinion of Lincoln’s former Secretary of the Treasury.
Chief Justice Chase could conceive of a situation in which Congress
might find such measures “essential to the prosecution of the war
with vigor and success,” and would therefore be entitled under the Constitution
to resort to them. Independent of statutory authorization
the President, however, could not employ such power. He was limited
to executing the measures adopted by Congress.<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></p>

<p>Some eighty years later, in 1941, martial law was declared in Hawaii.
From that time through the Fall of 1945, the Islands were ruled by
the military. After bitter and protracted litigation, in which the
federal courts in Honolulu were particularly outspoken against the
type of military rule practiced in the Islands, the cases of <cite>Duncan</cite> v.
<cite>Kahanamoku</cite> and <cite>White</cite> v. <cite>Steer</cite> managed to surmount the obstacle
course to the Supreme Court.<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> Duncan and White were civilians who
had been apprehended during the war and tried and convicted by
the military, the former for assault against a Marine sentry, and the
latter for embezzlement. Both were crimes under the Hawaiian civil
code. Challenging the jurisdiction of the military to try these men, a
lower federal court ordered their release upon petition for habeas
corpus; and on appeal the validity of the District Court order was
sustained by the Supreme Court in an opinion written by Justice
Black. The case turned upon a narrow interpretation of the meaning
of “martial law.” The term did not, Black said, embrace trial of
civilians by military courts. He did leave the door ajar, however,
implying that it is not inconceivable in a situation of dire necessity,
that such trial of civilians by the military might be upheld.</p>

<p>In a concurring opinion, however, Justice Murphy restated the
principle expressed in the <cite>Milligan</cite> case. Exalting civilian supremacy
over the military, he reiterated the <cite>Milligan</cite> rule that civilians may not
be tried by the military when the courts are open and functioning.
Not only did he agree with Justice Black that the acts of the military
contravened statutory law, but he also was of the belief they were
proscribed by the due process clause and therefore manifestly unconstitutional.
Unlike the Civil War Justices, however, he suggested
that until the courts were able to resume their functions the military
might retain custody of its prisoners.<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a></p>

<p><em>Extra-Constitutional Sources of Emergency Power:</em> Perhaps the
most expansive argument for a constitutionally sanctioned, unqualified
emergency power is that developed and expressed by Justice George
Sutherland in a work published in 1919,<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> before his accession to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
bench, and restated in his opinion for the Court in <cite>United States</cite> v.
<cite>Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> In <cite>Constitutional Power and
World Affairs</cite>, he asserted:</p>

<p>“As the highest duty of the nation is self-preservation, the rights
of peace must then be held in subjection to the necessities of war.
This does not result in a suspension of the Constitution, as some have
petulantly suggested, but it may result in a suspension of constitutional
rights of the individual because they conflict with the paramount
powers of war....</p>

<p>“This power is tremendous; it is strictly constitutional; but it breaks
down every barrier so anxiously erected for the protection of liberty,
of property and of life.”<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a></p>

<p>The later Supreme Court opinion only removes the inconsistencies
from these passages, and recognizes the war powers as extra-constitutional
in nature:</p>

<p>“It results that the investment of the federal government with
the powers of external sovereignty did not depend upon the affirmative
grants of the Constitution. The powers to declare and wage war,
to conclude peace, to make treaties, to maintain diplomatic relations
with other sovereignties, if they had never been mentioned in the
Constitution, would have been vested in the federal government as
necessary concomitants of nationality.”<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a></p>

<p>Justice Jackson, dissenting in the Japanese relocation case, <cite>Korematsu</cite>
v. <cite>United States</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> advocated complete judicial abnegation of
any pretended power to review the necessity for emergency action.
Favoring, however, a reversal of the judgment and a “discharge of the
prisoner,” Jackson added that he couldn’t subscribe to the view
that the existence of “reasonable military grounds” for such a wartime
program made it constitutionally valid and subject to judicial
enforcement.<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> The Court cannot</p>

<p>“... require such a commander in such circumstances to act as a
reasonable man; he may be unreasonably cautious and exacting.
Perhaps he should be....</p>

<p>“But if we cannot confine military expedients by the Constitution,
neither would I distort the Constitution to approve all that the military
may deem expedient....</p>

<p>“A military commander may overstep the bounds of constitutionality,
and it is an incident. But if we review and approve, that
passing incident becomes a doctrine of the Constitution ... a judicial
opinion rationalizes such an order to show that it conforms to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
Constitution, or rather rationalizes the Constitution to show that the
Constitution sanctions such an order....”<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a></p>

<p>It is true that the existence of this power in the government in
wartime, and the admitted inability of the Court to restrict it, is “an
inherent threat to liberty.”</p>

<p>“But I would not lead people to rely on this Court for a review
that seems to me wholly delusive. The military reasonableness of
these orders can only be determined by the military superiors. If
the people ever let command of the war power fall into irresponsible
hands, the courts wield no power equal to its restraint. The chief
restraint upon those who command the physical forces of the country,
in the future as in the past, must be their responsibilities to the
political judgments of their contemporaries and to the moral judgments
of history.”<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a></p>

<p>Like Machiavelli, Jackson conducts an analysis in simple power
terms. But while Machiavelli suggested it was possible to devise
ways to circumscribe and check the exercise of emergency power by
leaders in a republic, the modern liberal, true to the tradition of Locke,
can conceive of no limits upon the actions of a war government but
the force of public opinion.</p>

<p><em>The Constitution as a Flexible Charter</em>: Although as recently as
World War II all three strains of thought regarding emergency powers
of the Chief Executive during wartime found effective expression in
opinions of individual justices on the Court, the most persistent has
been the attempt to compromise the range of views by positing a Constitution
broad and flexible enough to encompass emergency action
responsive to existing need, as measured by the Court. This has been
described by Professor Corwin as “constitutional relativity.”<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a></p>

<p>The “clear and present danger” doctrine, first enunciated by Justice
Holmes in the <cite>Schenck</cite> case<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> is an example of constitutional
relativity. Its recent application illustrates what is to be expected
when the Court, having accepted the obligation to determine the
necessity for emergency action, subsequently is led by doubts as to
the adequacy of its tools for measurement to redefine the conditions
of an emergency in such a manner as virtually to evade the problem.<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>
It also points up some of the difficulties in consistently applying whatever
criteria for measurement are developed by the Court.</p>

<p>Schenck had been convicted under the Espionage Act of 1917 for
seeking to obstruct the draft. He had circularized a mailing list
with literature opposing the World War I draft law. Included on the
list were a number of persons in the military service at the time of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
receipt of the material. Holmes’ reasoned as follows:</p>

<p>“The question in every case is whether the words used are used
in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear
and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils
that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity
and degree....</p>

<p>“It seems to be admitted that if an actual obstruction of the recruiting
service were proved, liability for words that produced that
effect might be enforced.... If the act, ... its tendency and the intent
with which it is done are the same, we perceive no ground for
saying that success alone warrants making the act a crime.”<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p>

<p>Schenck remained in jail.</p>

<p>In a subsequent case under the same Act, involving a group of
“radicals” who had disseminated a pamphlet condemning United
States intervention in Russia and threatening to thwart that intervention
by causing trouble on the home front, calling upon munitions
workers to quit their jobs, and advocating revolution, Holmes dissented
from a decision upholding their conviction.<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> Rejecting as
fallacious the conclusion of his colleagues that the surreptitious publishing
of a “silly leaflet by an unknown man, without more, would
present any immediate danger that its opinions would hinder the
success of the government arms or have any appreciable tendency
to do so,” Holmes maintained:</p>

<p>“An intent to prevent interference with the revolution in Russia
might have been satisfied without any hindrance to carrying on the
war in which we were engaged....</p>

<p>“Even if I am technically wrong and enough can be squeezed from
these poor and puny anonymities to turn the color of legal litmus
paper; I will add, even if what I think the necessary intent were shown;
the most nominal punishment seems to me all that possibly could be
inflicted, unless the defendants are to be made to suffer not for what
the indictment alleges but for the creed that they avow....”<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a></p>

<p>The significance of this latter opinion would appear to derive from
the fact that by employing the descriptive adjectives “silly” and
“puny” Holmes transformed his clear and present danger doctrine
into a vehicle for opposing conviction of persons for what would
seem, on the face of the record, possibly a more aggravated offense
than Schenck’s. Thus the “clear and present danger” test in application
may become entangled with the sentiment of the person applying
it. Secondly, it is important to note the appraisal which Holmes
made as to the military significance of American intervention in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
Russia. In his estimation, had it been thwarted our war effort would
not have been effected. As a dissenter Holmes, with the support of
Brandeis, persisted in applying the “clear and present danger” test
in a number of later decisions, notably the <cite>Gitlow</cite> case and the <cite>Whitney</cite>
case.<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p>

<p>In the post-World War II era, however, this test definitely appears
to have been radically altered, if not conclusively rejected. Thus
in <cite>Dennis</cite> v. <cite>United States</cite>, sustaining the conviction under the Smith
Act<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> of eleven top Communist Party leaders, Judge Learned Hand,
presiding over the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,
stated:</p>

<p>“The phrase, ‘clear and present danger,’ has come to be used as a
shorthand statement of those among such mixed or compounded
utterances which the Amendment does not protect.... It is a way
to describe a penumbra of occasions, even the outskirts of which are
indefinable, but within which, as is so often the case, the courts must
find their way as they can. In each case they must ask whether
the gravity of the ‘evil,’ discounted by its improbability, justified
such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger....</p>

<p>“... When does the conspiracy become a ‘present danger’? The
jury has found that the conspirators will strike as soon as success
seems possible, and obviously, no one in his senses would strike sooner.
[Meanwhile, the Communist leaders claim the right to continue their
activities.] That position presupposes that the Amendment assures
them freedom for all preparatory steps and in the end, the choice of
initiative, dependent upon the moment when they believe us, who
must wait the blow, to be the worst prepared to receive it.”<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a></p>

<p>By substituting “probability” for “imminence” in time, Hand
substantially changed the clear and present danger doctrine. On
appeal the Supreme Court, with certain modifications, in effect affirmed
Hand’s redefinition.<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a></p>

<p>In connection with these examples of judicial application of the
“clear and present danger” doctrine it is equally pertinent to set
forth Chief Justice Hughes’ famous dictum that “the war power of the
Federal Government ... is a power to wage war successfully,”<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> and
to refer to the decisions arising out of World War II Japanese curfew
and relocation<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> and rent control.<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a>
    The Court’s approach is epitomized
by Black’s reasoning in his majority opinion in <cite>Korematsu</cite> v. <cite>United
States</cite>:</p>

<p>“But when under conditions of modern warfare our shores are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
threatened by hostile forces, the power to protect must be commensurate
with the threatened danger....</p>

<p>“... hardships are a part of war, and war is an aggregation of
hardships. All citizens alike, both in and out of uniform, feel the
impact of war in greater or lesser measure.”<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a></p>

<p>Whether the Court is competent to fulfill the role of protector of the
Constitution in wartime is highly debatable. Is the Court capable
of performing the task, even if time were available? Obviously not.
It does not have the information requisite for determination of current
needs and the adequacy and appropriateness of government actions
to meet them. It cannot be presumed to possess the fund of knowledge
essential for appraising issues largely military in nature, and,
consequently upon the advent of actual hostilities, it invariably
displays a reluctance to countermand the executive and legislative
branches, no matter how extreme their action. Furthermore, the
judicial process with its haphazard accretion of cases, the manifest
capacity of government to make cases moot, or failure to prosecute,
frequently makes it impossible for the Court even to review significant
controversies produced by action of the political departments.
For every Milligan or Duncan who manages to bring his case to the
Court (usually for post mortem relief), there are hundreds who
submit to abusive governmental action without ever contesting the
validity thereof. This alone affords adequate demonstration that the
court is ineffective in maintaining constitutionalism in time of war.
For fulfillment of this objective vigilance on the part of Congress
and the Executive no less than the electorate is imperative.</p>

<p>In a democracy the function of defending liberty cannot safely be
relegated to any single institution.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A More Effective Emergency Role for the Judiciary</span></h3>

<p>Judicial oversight of government emergency action has suffered
from concentration upon the question of the existence of power. In
the context of emergency the Court can best preserve for itself and
the Federal judicial system a meaningful role in preserving constitutional
processes if it is invited to measure the consistency of executive
action both to executive standards and congressional grants of power,<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a>
rather than to rhetorically assert a right to admonish a government—Congress
and President, armed, mobilized and engaged in war, that
the measures which it employs for protection of the nation are unconstitutional.
In testing the vires of administrative action the
courts are acting in an area vital to the preservation of responsible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
government, and in which cooperative legislative-executive validation
of judicially disapproved action represents the essence of constitutionalism
rather than constitutional immorality.<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>


<h4>THE STEEL SEIZURE CASES<a id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a></h4>

<p>When, on April 8, 1952, President Truman issued Executive Order
10340 directing seizure of the steel industry,<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> he set in motion a train
of events which were to culminate in an historic series of concurring
opinions which may herald a significant change in emphasis on the
part of the Court. The effect of the majority and concurring opinions
in this case is effectively to curb and subject to Congressional sanction
a kind of “homemade prerogative”<a id="FNanchor_757" href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> which the President had
asserted, and to reassert the primacy of the Court’s role as a balancing
agent in the constitutional system. Four days before issuance of the
Executive Order, the C.I.O. United Steelworkers of America had
given notice of a nation-wide strike to begin on April 9.<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> Alleging in
his Order that such a strike would undermine American attempts
to fulfill international responsibilities, to maintain a steady supply
of war materials to the fighting force in Korea, and to maintain the
domestic economy of the nation, the President invoked “the authority
vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and
as President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of the
armed forces of the United States,” as his legal justification for directing
the Secretary of Commerce “to take possession of” the steel
plants.</p>

<p>On April 9th, Judge Alexander Holtzoff in the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia rejected the application of
Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co., <i lang="la">et al.</i>, for an injunction and declaratory
judgment protecting the mills from seizure by the Secretary of
Commerce.<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> The District Court stated two grounds in support of its
ruling. (1) While it might technically run against Secretary of
Commerce Sawyer, an injunction “actually and in essence ... would be
an injunction against the President.” (2) The steel companies had
not shown irreparable harm.<a id="FNanchor_760" href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a></p>

<p>Three weeks later the steel companies instituted new proceedings
before Judge David A. Pine of the District Court, District of Columbia.<a id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>
Injunctive relief was now sought on grounds that the seizure
of the mills, not having been authorized by statute, was unconstitutional.<a id="FNanchor_762" href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>
The government’s presentation was completely prejudiced
by the insistence of the Assistant Attorney General that the President’s
actions be upheld on grounds of his “inherent” emergency powers.<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span></p>

<p>The Court: “And is it ... your view that the powers of the Government
are limited by and enumerated in the Constitution of the
United States?”</p>

<p>Mr. Baldridge: “That is true, Your Honor, with respect to legislative
powers.”</p>

<p>The Court: “But it is not true, you say, as to the Executive?”</p>

<p>Mr. Baldridge: “No.”</p>

<p>The Court: “So, when the sovereign people adopted the Constitution,
it enumerated the powers set up in the Constitution but limited
the powers of the Congress and limited the powers of the judiciary,
but it did not limit the powers of the Executive. Is that what you
say?”</p>

<p>Mr. Baldridge: “That is the way we read Article II of the Constitution.”<a id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a></p>

<p>Judge Pine ruled that the President’s action was unsupported by
law and granted the injunction.</p>

<p>While the government’s claim to an inherent emergency power
may have been extreme, it was a natural culmination of the trend
of judicial and scholarly interpretation of emergency powers through
the Second World War. Two authoritative sources existed, each
providing plausible underpinning for executive assertion of inherent
emergency powers—unlimited by Constitution, Congress or Court.
The first was judicial language such as the Sutherland dicta in <cite>United
States</cite> v. <cite>Curtiss-Wright</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> The second embraced commentaries by
persons generally considered qualified to write exegeses on the Constitution,
wherein the previously unchallenged exercise of emergency
power by the President has been viewed as controlling precedent
legitimizing the acquisition of such power. Thus, as of 1952, in the
minds of many, the President had built up imposing historical precedent
for the exercise of executive discretion adequate to accomplish
whatever purposes appeared to him essential to counter an emergency.<a id="FNanchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a>
In many instances, however, such action has frequently violated
explicit provisions of the Constitution or of congressional statutes.<a id="FNanchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a></p>

<p>Justice Frankfurter indicated his acceptance of the validity of
this line of reasoning when in his concurring opinion in the <cite>Steel Seizure</cite>
cases he asserted that “... a systematic, unbroken, executive practice,
long pursued to the knowledge of the Congress and never before
questioned, engaged in by Presidents who have also sworn to uphold
the Constitution, making as it were such exercise of power part of
the structure of our government, may be treated as a gloss on ‘executive
power’ vested in the President by Sec. 1 of Ar. II.”<a id="FNanchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span></p>

<p>By the ruling sustained, however, the District Court and the
majority of the Supreme Court lent color of authority to the steel
companies’ contention that “There could be no more dangerous principle—nor
one more foreign to the Constitution—than a rule that
past illegality can through some legerdemain serve as authority to
legalize present illegality.”<a id="FNanchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> Justice Jackson disposed of the Solicitor
General’s contention that although Congress had not provided for
seizure of the steel mills, the practice of past Presidents did authorize it,
by stating that while it was not surprising that the Government
should seek support for nebulous, inherent powers in the customs and
unadjudicated claims of preceding administrations, “a judge cannot
accept [executive self-assertions of power] ... as authority in answering
a constitutional question.... Prudence has counseled that actual
reliance on such nebulous claims stop short of provoking a judicial
test.”<a id="FNanchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a></p>

<p>The government went into the Court of Appeals, District of Columbia
Circuit, seeking an order staying the injunction pending submission
of a petition for <i lang="la">certiorari</i> to the Supreme Court.<a id="FNanchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> The order
was granted<a id="FNanchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> on May 2, and the following day the Supreme Court
granted <i lang="la">certiorari</i>, staying the District Court order pending final
disposition of the cases.<a id="FNanchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a></p>

<p>Avoiding the bold and indiscreet assertion of undefined inherent
powers which had so prejudiced the government’s case in the District
Court, Solicitor General Philip B. Perlman on appeal to the Supreme
Court submitted a brief devoted to establishing the existence of an
emergency of sufficient magnitude to warrant extraordinary action on
the part of the executive.<a id="FNanchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> As assurance of the President’s willingness
to subject himself to the desires of Congress, the brief cited his communication
to the Senate of April 21, 1952, offering to adhere to any
positive line of action prescribed by Congress.<a id="FNanchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> The remainder of the
brief enumerates the historical and judicial precedent affording a
legal justification of the steel seizure<a id="FNanchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> and concludes with an argument
to the effect that the proper remedy available to the steel companies
was suit for just compensation in the Court of Claims.<a id="FNanchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a></p>

<p>In the light of the facts of the case counsel for the steel companies
could most efficiently sustain their contentions by emphasizing the
impropriety of executive seizure in plain opposition to the obvious intent
of Congress expressed in a statute anticipating such emergency
and explicitly providing a different solution. They avoided challenging
the constitutionality in the absence of a statute of an emergency
power to seize private productive facilities. In fact, the steel companies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
openly conceded the existence of broad emergency power.
They made it clear that their view “does not mean that the Government
is powerless to deal with the threat to steel production which
arises from the current labor dispute.” If necessary “... Congress
can legislate appropriately and specifically to protect the nation from
threatened disaster.”<a id="FNanchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> The determining factor in assessing the
legitimacy of government action in this case, however, was the nature
of the legislative-executive relationship involved. Presidential action,
the companies argued, could be arranged on a “spectrum” of legitimacy<a id="FNanchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a>—at
one end, cooperative executive-legislative action. Congress
and President might unite in the execution of a program or
Congress subsequently might ratify a prior exercise of power by the
executive.<a id="FNanchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> At the other end, as in this case, the presidential action
violates a clear congressional intent.<a id="FNanchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a></p>

<p>Here “... the statutory processes have been ignored ...,”<a id="FNanchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> and an
early but eminent constitutional precedent was cited as squarely
meeting the instant situation. An Act passed by Congress in 1799
suspended commercial intercourse between the United States and
France during the undeclared naval war between the two nations.
The act provided that no American vessel should be permitted to
proceed to any French port under penalty of forfeiture, and authorized
the seizure of all American ships bound <em>to</em> any French ports.
President Adams instructed commanders of United States armed
vessels to seize all American ships bound <em>to</em> or <em>from</em> French ports.
Acting under these presidential instructions, Captain Little stopped
and seized on the high seas a vessel bound <em>from</em> a French port. The
Court through Chief Justice John Marshall held that Congress had
prescribed by its legislation the manner of which seizures were to be
carried into execution and had excluded the seizure of any vessel
bound <em>from</em> rather than <em>to</em> a French port. And even though the
executive construction was calculated to increase the effectiveness
of the legislation, the executive had no right to expand the law as
enacted.<a id="FNanchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a></p>

<p>Justice Black for the majority of the Court rejected the notion that
unchallenged emergency action by former Presidents provided any
solid legal precedent for Truman’s seizure of the steel mills.<a id="FNanchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> “The
President’s power to issue the order must stem either from an act of
Congress or from the Constitution itself.”<a id="FNanchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> The seizure order could
not be sustained by any of the constitutional grants of executive
power to the President.<a id="FNanchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> The President, rather than basing his
order upon a specific statute, had chosen to direct “that a presidential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
policy be executed in a manner prescribed by the President.”<a id="FNanchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> Black
did not question “the power of Congress to adopt such public policies
as those proclaimed by the order.” The action of the President in
initiating such a policy was, however, an unconstitutional arrogation of
“lawmaking power” to the executive.<a id="FNanchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a></p>

<p>Justice Black avoided citation of judicial precedent in that portion
of his opinion which invalidated the President’s action. The reason
for this is clear, and has been stated succinctly by Professor Edward
S. Corwin in comments upon the <cite>Steel Seizure</cite> cases:</p>

<p>“The doctrine of the case, as stated in Justice Black’s opinion of
the Court, while purporting to stem from the principle of separation
of powers, is a purely arbitrary construction created out of hand for
the purpose of disposing of this particular case, and is altogether
devoid of historical verification.”<a id="FNanchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p>

<p>Each of the six justices who concurred in Black’s majority opinion
in the <cite>Steel Seizure</cite> cases stated his reasons in full.<a id="FNanchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> By far the most
lucid, best reasoned, and most adequate of any of the opinions appears
to be that of Justice Jackson. He avoided the oversimplification of
issues which weakens Black’s opinion. Filling the theoretical lacunae
which Black in his hasty advance to the target (invalidation of Truman’s
action) left in his wake, Jackson recognized that the real issue
of the case was not that the President had taken emergency action
unsupported by a declaration of legislative policy, but that his
measures had been “incompatible with the expressed or implied will
of Congress.”<a id="FNanchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> Justice Jackson founded his opinion upon the concept
of our government as a “balanced power structure.”<a id="FNanchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> The Constitution
disperses power among the branches of government, but contemplates
that practice will achieve the integration essential to
effective government. “Interdependence” rather than “separateness”
is the relationship that must exist. The powers of a President in
time of emergency are not, as the Government had argued, comprehensive
and undefined; neither are they fixed, “but fluctuate,
depending upon their disjunction or conjunction with those of Congress.”<a id="FNanchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a>
Jackson enumerates alternatives of Presidential-Congressional
relationships which may determine the extent of executive
power:</p>

<p>“1. When the President acts pursuant to an express or implied
authorization of Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it
includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress
can delegate....</p>

<p>“2. When the President acts in absence of either a congressional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
grant or denial of authority, he can only rely upon his own independent
powers....</p>

<p>“3. When the President takes measures incompatible with the
expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb,
for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus
any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter....”<a id="FNanchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a></p>

<p>The seizure of the steel mills by President Truman in face of a
contrary congressional policy fell into the third of these categories
and left presidential power “most vulnerable to attack and in the least
favorable of possible constitutional postures.” The Court could
sustain the President’s action “only by holding that seizure of such
strike-bound industries is within his domain and beyond control by
Congress.”<a id="FNanchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a></p>

<p>Also concurring, Mr. Justice Clark relied on the precedent of <cite>Little</cite>
v. <cite>Barreme</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> Although “the Constitution does grant to the President
extensive authority in times of grave and imperative emergency”<a id="FNanchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a>
and in the absence of Congressional action “the President’s independent
power to act depends upon the gravity of the situation confronting
the nation,”<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> the lesson of <cite>Little</cite> v. <cite>Barreme</cite> and sound
constitutional exposition demand that “where Congress has laid down
specific procedures to deal with the type of crisis confronting the
President, he must follow those procedures in meeting the crisis....”<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a></p>

<p>In his dissenting opinion Chief Justice Vinson maintained that the
majority justices had each assumed the unarticulated major premise
that the emergency was not of sufficient gravity to warrant the
mode of action adopted by the President. The Chief Justice chided
his colleagues for not weighing the magnitude of the emergency
accurately.<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> But this seems hardly a warrantable criticism of a group
of opinions which manifested little concern with substantive constitutional
limitations upon executive emergency action, but rather emphasized
the necessity for compliance with a congressional program anticipating
such an emergency and prescribing the mode of response to it.</p>


<h4>THE STEEL STRIKE OF 1959</h4>

<p>In 1959 the nation’s great steel industry once again occupied the
center of a dispute which had far reaching consequences.</p>

<p>The dispute was that between representatives of the twelve largest
steel producers in the United States and representatives of the United
Steelworkers of America, the union representing most of the non-supervisory
employees employed in the steel industry.</p>

<p>As the time for negotiating new contracts between the union and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
steel companies drew near the deadline date of June 30, 1959, it became
evident to representatives of both labor and management that
no agreement for new contracts would be reached. Shortly before the
June 30th deadline the parties agreed at the request of President
Eisenhower, to extend the old agreements for two weeks. By July 15,
there was still no settlement, and a strike by 500,000 steelworkers
began immediately.</p>

<p>From July until early November the steelworkers refused to return
to their jobs. Although negotiations continued between union and
management representatives no settlement of the dispute was
reached. The President sought during the 116 day old strike
to have the strike settled without recourse to the Labor-Management
Relations Act (Taft-Hartley) of 1947. On September 8, President
Eisenhower wrote a letter to the United Steelworkers of America
and to the steel companies in which he expressed disappointment
that so little progress toward settlement of the steel dispute had been
made, and he urged the parties to act expeditiously to reach agreement.<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a></p>

<p>As the impact of the strike was felt in an ever-widening sector
of the American economy, the President of the United States took the
first step under the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a> by
issuing Executive Order No. 10843 pursuant to section 206 of the
Act.<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> He appointed a board of inquiry to inquire into the issues involved
in the dispute and to make a written report to him. In the
Executive Order, the President expressed the opinion that the strike,
if permitted to continue would imperil the national health and
safety. In his statement explaining his issuance of the Executive
Order, the President pointed to the “shutting off” of practically all
new supplies of steel, the unemployment of hundreds of thousands of
employees in steel and related industries, and the imminent threat
to the economic health of the nation if production was not quickly
resumed.</p>

<p>The Board of Inquiry submitted its written report to the President
on October 19<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> setting forth a summary of the negotiations up to
October 19 and the issues in dispute between the parties.<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> The Board
concluded that “we see no prospects for an early cessation of the
strike. The Board cannot point to any single issue of any consequence
whatsoever upon which the parties are in agreement.”<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a></p>

<p>Upon receiving the report, the President directed the Attorney
General to petition any district court having jurisdiction over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
parties to enjoin the continuance of the strike and to order such
other relief as might be necessary or appropriate.</p>

<p>On October 20, 1959, the Attorney General filed a petition in the
United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania,
seeking an injunction against the union and the steel companies pursuant
to section 208 of the Taft-Hartley Act.<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> The Government’s
petition described the requisite statutory steps which had been taken
by the President, and alleged that prolongation of the widespread strike
in the steel industry would imperil the health and safety of the country.
In summary form the petition stated some of the consequences of the
strike on employment, both in the steel industry and many other
areas of the economy, on the availability of essential steel products,
and on vital national defense projects.<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> The strike had shut down
approximately 85 percent of the steel producing capacity of the
United States. More than 765,000 persons had been made idle by
the strike. If it were allowed to continue, strike-caused unemployment
would have reached three million by January 1, 1960.</p>

<p>A considerable amount of evidence was presented concerning the
effect of the strike on the national defense program. The District
Court found that certain steel products needed in connection with
some aspects of the defense program were unavailable because of the
steel strike.</p>

<p>Particular stress was put on the impact of the tie-up on the output
of missiles, nuclear submarines and advanced types of rocket engines.
The Defense Department reported that two plants supplying component’s
for the Polaris missile had been forced to stop production
for lack of alloy steel and four others had given notice of the need
to do the same within a few days.<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> Moreover, the top priority
Project Mercury, an essential part of the nation’s space program
was being injured. Exported steel products, vital to the support of
the nation’s overseas bases, for NATO, and similar collective security
groups would be cut off; continuance of the strike would impair
these programs, thus imperiling the national safety.</p>

<p>On these facts, the District Court made the conclusory finding that
the strike imperiled the national health and safety and issued an
injunction. The court rejected the union’s argument that the statute
is unconstitutional because it authorizes the court to issue an injunction
which does not enforce a pre-existing legal obligation, but
merely creates such an obligation. The court did not pass on the
union’s further argument that it should, in the exercise of its equitable
discretion, refuse to issue an injunction in this case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span></p>

<p>The union promptly filed an appeal and moved the District Court
for a brief stay to enable the Union to apply to Judge Staley of the
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit for a stay pending appeal.</p>

<p>The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court.
Chief Judge Biggs, writing for the majority, analyzed and rejected
the union’s contention that there was no “case or controversy” before
the federal court which it could adjudicate in the sense required
by the Constitution. Turning to the critical findings of the District
Court dealing with the impact of the steel strike, the majority concluded,
after a detailed review of the entire record, that the findings of
the lower court were not clearly erroneous. Significantly, the majority
noted that:</p>

<p>“We cannot accept the Union’s argument in this respect. If our
conclusion is correct that there is sufficient evidence in the record of
the present or future danger to national health or safety, we conclude
that the danger is great enough and calls for a remedy as sweeping as
the law will permit. Whether the remedy provided by the Labor-Management
Relations Act is sufficient to accomplish a cessation of
labor strife is a question not for this court but for Congress. We conclude,
therefore, that the court below did not abuse its discretion in
granting the relief which the United States prayed for.”<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a></p>

<p>The Supreme Court acted with unusual speed. The Court set Tuesday,
November 3, 1959 at 11 a.m. as the time for oral argument. All
briefs had to be on file by noon, Monday, November 2, 1959. The
injunction issued by the U. S. District Court for the Western District
of Pennsylvania on October 21, 1959 as modified by the United States
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on October 22, 1959, was stayed
pending the issuance of the judgment of Supreme Court. The petition
for <i lang="la">certiorari</i>, was filed by the union counsel at 1 p.m. The Government’s
response, asking the court to deny review and thus let the
injunction stand, arrived about 4 p.m.</p>

<p>Half an hour later the nine Justices met in conference, the session
lasting 40 minutes. Reporters learned of the unscheduled meeting
from the ringing of gongs that call the Justices to all formal conferences.
Out of the session came an order in the case entitled <cite>United
Steel Workers of America</cite>, Petitioner v. <cite>United States</cite>, <i lang="la">et al.</i><a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a></p>

<p>The Supreme Court’s opinion was brief. In the <i lang="la">Per Curiam</i> Opinion,
the Court stated its acceptance of, and concurrence in, the findings
of the lower Federal Courts which had adjudicated the case:</p>

<p>“... Petitioner here contests the findings that the continuation of
the strike would imperil the national health and safety. The parties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
dispute the meaning of the statutory term ‘national health’; the Government
insists that the term comprehends the country’s general well-being,
its economic health; petitioner urges that simply the physical
health of the citizenry is meant. We need not resolve this question,
for we think the judgment ... is amply supported on the ground that
the strike imperils the national safety. Here we rely upon the evidence
of the strike’s effect on specific defense projects; we need not pass on
the Government’s contention that ‘national safety’ in this context
should be given a broader construction and application.</p>

<p>“... The statute was designed to provide a public remedy in times
of emergency; we cannot construe it to require that the United States
either formulate a reorganization of the affected industry to satisfy
its defense needs without the complete reopening of closed facilities, or
demonstrate in court the unfeasibility of such a reorganization. There
is no room in the statute for this requirement which the petitioner
seeks to impose on the Government.”<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a></p>

<p>The steel strike was finally settled on January 4, 1960, following
all-night negotiations between the Vice-President, the Secretary of
Labor, representatives of the steel companies and representatives of
the steel companies and representatives of the steelworker’s union.
Vice-President Nixon and Secretary of Labor Mitchell, acting under
instructions from President Eisenhower, had been conducting negotiations
for several weeks with the parties to the dispute.</p>

<p>While all parties involved were gratified to have this long and costly
strike ended, the method of settlement does not confirm the efficacy
of the emergency provision of the Taft-Hartley Act. Indeed, it is
further confirmation of the fact that the American approach to emergency
powers has imposed upon successive executives, not only the
incentive, but the absolute need to resort to extra-statutory means for
settling emergencies.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="smcap">Chapter XI</span>
<br><span class="cheaderfont">CONCLUSIONS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The doctrine of constitutional dictatorship is inappropriate for analysis
of the problem of democratic response to emergency.</p>

<p>Judicial review of a chief executive’s finding that an emergency
exists amounts to involvement of Supreme Court Justices in a genre
of decision-making which should more properly be performed by the
President and Congress, although the 1959 Steel Seizure decision reveals
the effective role which the Supreme Court may play in holding
the President to the forms of emergency action prescribed by the Congress,
if the Congress has so prescribed them.</p>

<p>The recurrent trouble which the nation has confronted in taking
timely and effective emergency action at the national level stems
from the existence on the statute books of a confusing array of provisions
for the declaration of various kinds of emergency, and the excessively
precise definition of the techniques which must be employed
in coping with the emergency. This invites efforts at evasion of
statutory limitations as in the instance of the 1952 steel strike, or requires
recurrent special legislation dealing with successive particularized
emergencies. Also, in forewarning the private parties in dispute,
in the case of a strike, of the precise time-table and program of action
to which the executive must adhere, it may lessen their incentive to
settle the dispute, for the course of action prescribed by statute may,
depending upon the situation, strengthen the bargaining position of
one of the disputants.</p>

<p>The recent use of the concurrent resolution in Congress provides
a key to the means for equipping the President with the broad discretion
he should have to identify conditions warranting emergency action,
and to select the appropriate tools to deal with an emergency,
while simultaneously keeping him under Congressional surveillance and
control.</p>

<p>We propose a generic statute to empower the President to proclaim
a national or regional emergency. Under such a proclamation the
President may issue rules and regulations which have the force of law.
A proclamation of emergency would be placed before the Congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
within twenty-four hours of its issuance. If Congress were not in session,
it would be called into session within five days from the time of the
declaration of emergency. The proclamation of emergency would stand
unless revoked by concurrent resolution by both Houses of Congress
within five days of Congress’ coming into special session.</p>

<p>The rules and regulations issued under the proclamation would be
similarly subject to revocation by concurrent resolution and Congress
should possess the item veto in this respect; i.e., it may revoke
one rule, while permitting others to stand. An emergency proclamation
and regulations issued under it, would automatically expire after
thirty days, but would be subject to reissuance by the President, provided
the Congress concurred. Congress, upon the issuance of an
emergency proclamation would establish a scrutiny committee on
emergency powers, patterned after the Joint Committee on Atomic
Energy. Congress would maintain continuous scrutiny of the administration
of powers exercised under the proclamation. The Committee’s
primary responsibility would be to keep Congress sufficiently
advised as to whether powers had been responsibly administered.</p>

<p>There is nothing novel about this proposal. The British have operated
under similar statutes in peace and war for fifty years with a
record of great success in two respects:</p>

<p>(1) They reacted efficiently to emergencies ranging from a dock
strike, and a general strike to two world wars;</p>

<p>(2) Powers during an emergency have been responsibly administered
under Parliamentary observation and control.</p>

<p>Under this plan, the Executive can act, fully cloaked with legitimacy
to respond to emergencies ranging from a hydrogen attack to a capital
transit strike, and might employ techniques ranging from replacement
of state and local administrations which have been destroyed by hydrogen
bombings, to compelling motor-car men to return to work.</p>

<p>Such a statute exemplifies our commitment to democratic government
and democratic theory in a number of ways. It provides legislative
sanction for executive action and precludes the coming into being
of a situation which in the words of Locke, “the executive has to
act in the absence of law,” and it gives the President sufficiently broad
and generic power. As contrasted with the unrealistically detailed and
restrictive emergency provisions of existing statues, the President is
empowered to deal with an emergency without the need to resort to the
use of Locke’s prerogative: to act under the law, in the absence of the
law, or even contrary to the law. In effect it renders unnecessary and
unlikely that a future President will define the alternatives which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Lincoln once perceived: to act under the Constitution and lose the
Union, or to save the Union by transgressing against the Constitution.</p>

<p>Some persons will fear that a President might take action unnecessarily
under such a proclamation of emergency. The answer to this is
three-fold: first, it is in the nature of our political system that we must
repose a certain amount of faith in the basic integrity and wisdom
of the Chief Executive; secondly, the President must operate within
carefully prescribed procedural limitations; and third, the President
has only today to declare a nation-wide state of martial law in order to
equip himself with vast power to take emergency action virtually free
from concurring legislative participation.</p>

<p>The vital lesson which emerges from this study is that it is possible
to equip government to cope with the crises of Twentieth Century
existence without surrendering the two vital principles of constitutionalism
that have marked the course of American political development:
the maintenance of legal limits to arbitrary power, and political responsibility
of the government to the governed.</p>

<p>“The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally
in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of
men, at all times, and under all circumstances. No doctrine, involving more
pernicious consequences was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of
its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government.
Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or despotism; but the theory of
necessity on which it is based is false; for the government, within the constitution,
has all the powers granted to it, which are necessary to preserve its existence....</p>

<p>“... It could well be said that a country, preserved at the sacrifice of all
the cardinal principles of liberty, is not worth the cost of preservation.”</p>

extraordinary remedies, despite their doubtful constitutionality.” Perhaps as
broad a claim to an executive prerogative as has been made in the United States
is that which Lucius Wilmerding, Jr., bases upon his study of <cite>The Spending
Power</cite> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1943): “There are certain circumstances
which constitute a law of necessity and self-preservation and which render
the <i lang="la">salus populi</i> supreme over the written law. The officer who is called to act
upon this superior ground does indeed risk himself on the justice of the controlling
powers of the Constitution, but his station makes it his duty to incur
that risk.” p. 12.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> Suspension of the writ, and declaration of martial law were, of course, as
simulated in the raid itself. The story of the exercise may be traced in the
<cite>New York Times</cite>, June 16, 1955, pp. 1, 16; June 17, 1955, pp. 1, 10, 11. The
full text of the proclamation is available in Senate Committee on Armed Forces,
Subcommittee on Civil Defense, <cite>Hearings on the Civil Defense Program</cite>, Part
II, p. 746 (1955). Cf. Professor Charles Fairman’s remarks in “Government under
Law in Time of Crisis,” a paper presented at the Marshall Bicentennial Conference,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
Harvard Law School, September 1955: “Indeed it is rather a matter
for shame that we take so little thought for the morrow. More than mere individual
self-preservation is at stake. If we believe that the Western Civilization
we know is worth maintaining, if we are devoted to the conceptions of law
and justice as they have been defined in the course of our history, then surely we
should be moved to make them secure.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_12" href="#FNanchor_12" class="label">[12]</a> <i lang="la">Id.</i> It is this idea that emergency may require executive action contrary
to the law, <i lang="la">i.e.</i>, a suspension of law which is most dangerous to constitutional
morality. It presents the executive with false alternatives: “Was it possible to
lose the nation and yet preserve the Constitution?... I felt that measures otherwise
unconstitutional might become lawful by becoming indispensable to the
preservation of the nation.” Abraham Lincoln, letter to A. C. Hodges, April

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>


<h4><span class="smcap">Government as a Source of Information</span></h4>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_432" href="#FNanchor_432" class="label">[432]</a> See e.g., the collection of essays edited by Harry Elmer Barnes, <cite>Perpetual
War For Perpetual Peace</cite> (Caldwell, Idaho: 1952, Caxton Press). In his brilliant
history of American naval operations during the Second World War, Professor
Samuel Eliot Morison leaves little doubt that President Roosevelt recognized the
eventual need to come to military grips with Nazi aggression: “President Roosevelt,
considerably in advance of public opinion, apprehended the threat to American
security contained in the seizure of the Atlantic Coast of France, and the strong
possibility of a German invasion of Great Britain.” Samuel Eliot Morison, <cite>The
Battle of the Atlantic</cite>, 1939-1943, (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1947)
p. 27. Chapter III, “‘Short of War’ Policy” dramatically describes the efforts of the
Administration during the critical months of June 1940-March 1941 to sustain
Great Britain by any means at our disposal that did not involve an outright declaration
of war by the Germans. In Professor Morison’s estimation, Roosevelt
guessed right; Hitler could not afford to bring the United States into the war in
1940 or 1941 despite the trade of destroyers for bases with Britain, Lend-Lease,
and American aid to British convoys. <i lang="la">Id.</i>, p. 36.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_433" href="#FNanchor_433" class="label">[433]</a> In this regard a group of distinguished American historians wrote to the
<cite>New York Times</cite> as follows:</p>

<p>“On May 7 President Eisenhower issued Executive Order 10816 amending an
earlier order regarding the treatment of official documents. This order was generally
treated in the press as a liberalization of existing procedures, and we have
no doubt that this was the intention of its promulgators.</p>

<p>“However, in our view, the order proceeds in the wrong direction. We fear
that its consequence will be not to liberate the historian for the writing of independent
history but to entangle him in a series of potentially compromising
relations with the subject of his researches—in this case, the Government.</p>

<p>“The new Executive Order lays down three prerequisites before a student is
permitted to consult classified defense information in the writing of history.</p>

<p>“First, the head of the agency must rule that access to these records is ‘clearly
consistent with the interests of national defense.’ Second, the historian himself
must be determined to be ‘trustworthy’—a phrase which could be interpreted
as requiring security clearance. Third, his manuscript must be cleared.</p>

<p>“The enforcement of these three prerequisites will plainly make it difficult for
the most undaunted of historians to exercise the free and unfettered critical judgment
which is the heart of the historical enterprise. And, under prejudiced or incompetent
administration, this Executive Order could easily result in the restriction
of such official records to those historians prepared to accept and defend official
views.” (<cite>New York Times</cite>, October 25, 1959.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_692" href="#FNanchor_692" class="label">[692]</a> James C. Charlesworth, <cite>Government Administration</cite> (New York: Harper,
1951), pp. 252-53, attributes to the term “integration” the meaning “administrative
wholeness, or oneness, or entireness, or completeness of the elements under control.”
We would lend the term the same positive tone but use it to indicate
tendency or emphasis.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_693" href="#FNanchor_693" class="label">[693]</a> The words “co-operation” and “co-ordination” are taken from the texts of
statutes, and it is assumed that they have distinctive meanings in the law. “Joint
decision-making” and “mutual assistance” are obvious designations for the administrative
relationships described in the statutes concerned.</p>

<p>It would be digressive to incorporate any lengthy discussion of the concepts of
“co-operation” and “co-ordination” in the text of this book. It should, however,
be pointed out that they are fuzzy concepts, indeed, as employed in standard public
administration texts, and as defined in standard dictionaries. The indices of
Leonard D. White, <cite>Introduction to the Study of Public Administration</cite> (3rd ed.;
New York: Macmillan, 1948), John M. Pfiffner and R. Vance Presthus, <cite>Public
Administration</cite> (3rd ed.; New York: Ronald Press, 1953), and John D. Millet,
<cite>Management in the Public Service</cite> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1954), do not list
“co-operation.” Herbert A. Simon, Donald W. Smithburg, and Victor A. Thompson,
<cite>Public Administration</cite> (New York: Knopf, 1950), equate administration with co-operation:
“When two men co-operate to roll a stone neither could have moved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
alone, the rudiments of administration have appeared” (p. 3). “Any activity
involving the conscious co-operation of two or more persons can be called
organized activity.... Thus, by formal organization we mean a planned system
of co-operation effort in which each participant has a recognized role to play
and duties or tasks to perform” (p. 5). “... the dignity of the individual can be
respected only in an administrative situation in which all participants will
gain, in one way or another, from the accomplishment of the organization goal.
In such a situation, administration can be ‘co-operative’ in the broadest sense”
(p. 23). Charlesworth, <i lang="la">op. cit.</i>, imputes to co-operation the attributes of “a fast-moving
automatic machine, every part (of which) must be positively controlled,
so that at any particular phase of the machine’s operation, every part is in a
precisely predetermined place, and no other place” (p. 220).</p>

<p>Co-ordination, to James D. Mooney and Alan C. Reiley, <cite>Onward Industry</cite> (New
York: Harper, 1931), “expresses the principles of organization in toto.” All other
principles are merely those through which co-ordination acts. And co-ordination
means to “act together” (p. 19). White, having criticized Mooney and Reiley
for taking the concept of co-ordination to express “the whole of administration,”
suggests that “to co-ordinate is to bring about the consistent and harmonious action
of persons with each other toward a common end” (p. 210). This, some would
regard as a shorthand definition of administration.</p>

<p>Charlesworth, <i lang="la">op. cit.</i>, and Simon, <cite>Administrative Behavior</cite>, attempt to
distinguish between co-operation and co-ordination. Charlesworth’s effort is
perhaps the most elaborate, and Simon’s seems, in the context of this study, to have
the most operational utility. Charlesworth distinguishes between “vertical and
horizontal” co-ordination, and stresses that “co-ordination is promoted both structurally
and procedurally” (pp. 245-46). Apparently attributing to the term
“integration” the same meaning previously assigned to “co-operation” (“Administrative
integration means administrative wholeness, or oneness, or entireness, or
completeness of the elements of control.”), he distinguishes between integration
and co-ordination: “Integration is different from co-ordination in that co-ordination
relates to causing disjunct elements to work harmoniously together whereas integration
relates to the completeness and wholeness of the controls by which the harmony
is brought about....” (pp. 252-53).</p>

<p>Simon suggests that “Perhaps it would clarify discussion of administrative theory
to use the term ‘co-ordination’ for activity in which the participants share a common
goal, and ‘co-ordination’ for the process of informing each as to the planned behaviors
of the others. Hence, co-operation will usually be ineffective—will not
reach its goal, whatever the intentions of the participants—in the absence of co-ordination”
(p. 72).</p>

<p>These quotations have been placed in juxtaposition to illustrate existing inconsistencies
and ambiguities in the use of the terms co-operation and co-ordination
in most standard works on public administration in the United States.
It would be distortive of the purpose of this study to undertake to refine and relate
these concepts. We do suggest, however, that administrative theorists undertaking
this task could profitably seek insight in statutory materials and administrative histories—i.e.,
empirical data.</p>

court system as a whole and not limit ourselves entirely to the words uttered by
the Supreme Court. The damage to private rights and civilian principles can be
accomplished in the thousands of minor jurisdictions (Federal, State, Local) into
which our country is divided. Much of this damage is not brought to the notice
of the highest tribunal in the land, if at all, until years have elapsed. In one
of our earliest crises of national security, for example, the Alien and Sedition
Acts were passed (1798). Thousands of persons were imprisoned, and the Acts
were presently repealed. Their constitutionality was never passed upon by the
Supreme Court.” <cite>National Security and Individual Freedom</cite> (New York: McGraw-Hill,

great issues arising in periods of crisis, it has been unable to retain its traditional
potency. When the national security is imperiled, the Supreme Court, along with
the other branches of the government, becomes a part of the national mechanism
for preserving the existing social order.” We doubt that the Supreme Court and
the judicial system have adequately been integrated into this effort thus far.</p>

<p>The Court: “And you do not assert any express constitutional power.”</p>

1, 2 and 3 or Article II of the Constitution, and whatever inherent, implied or
residual powers may flow therefrom....”</p>

the emergency.”</p>
